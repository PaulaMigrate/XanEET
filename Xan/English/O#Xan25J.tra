@7    = ~Pass it on to us, so we share your fate? Why, thank you kindly.~
@8    = ~"Great One", please, come over here and deal with your so-called butler yourself. I am obviously too far beneath his notice.~

@17   = ~Thank you, <CHARNAME>. Now they are safe. Would that someone had done the same for us on a larger scale...~

@114  = ~(He hands you a small cool cup full of sparkling, clear water. You lean closer to the surface... and see a dazzling display of fireworks inside. They continue to shimmer, but as soon as you lean back, the surface is perfectly bland again.)~
@115  = ~(Xan gives you an enigmatic smile and leaves.)~
@116  = ~Look at this cloud, <CHARNAME>. I know it is insubstantial, and you cannot just put it into your backpack, but nevertheless - I want to give it to you. Just like that: this cloud is yours.~
@117  = ~It belongs to my <CHARNAME>...~
@118  = ~(Quietly, he puts his arms around your waist and kisses you on the cheek.)~

@127  = ~Ah... how lucky I am.~
@128  = ~(He tilts his head suspiciously.)~
@129  = ~<CHARNAME>, why are you looking at me like that?~
@130  = ~(Tenderly, he places a jasmine flower in your hair.)~
@131  = ~For luck.~
@132  = ~Love is indeed a wonderful feeling. I no longer want to talk every hour, or look at you every second: just being near you, breathing the same air is almost unbearable happiness.~
@133  = ~(Xan kneels, quickly takes off your shoes and shakes sand off them. He puts them on, and you feel the difference immediately.)~
@134  = ~(A smooth, narrow hand covers your eyes.)~
@135  = ~(Before you open your mouth, Xan steps from behind your back with a slightly guilty smile.)~
@136  = ~Tit for tat, <CHARNAME>.~
@137  = ~(He takes your hand and puts it over his eyes. For a moment, he stands still like a statue, then slowly brings your hand to his lips and kisses your palm once, twice, thrice.)~
@138  = ~(Xan approaches you and takes you in his arms. He holds you for a while, and you feel his presence long after his arms fall.)~
@139  = ~(His fingers touch yours, and an electric shock runs up your arm.)~
@140  = ~(You find a large, juicy yellow apple inside your pack.)~
@141  = ~(It is a completely ordinary apple, except that somebody has inscribed "<CHARNAME> the beautiful" on its side.)~
@142  = ~<CHARNAME>... it is amazing to be close to you again.~
@143  = ~It is a miracle.~
@144  = ~(Xan stretches out his arms, wraps them around an imaginary object and looks at you.)~
@145  = ~And I can do it for real.~
@146  = ~(And he does.)~
@147  = ~(His fingers run across your shoulders and back, barely touching them... and strangely, you feel light all of a sudden.)~
@148  = ~Magic, <CHARNAME>. Magic.~
@149  = ~(A small package of nuts finds its way into your hand.)~
@150  = ~(All of the nuts are completely ordinary... except that they all look heart-shaped. Perhaps this is a complete coincidence, but an unusually smug grin on Xan's face makes you suspect it is - not.)~
@151  = ~(Xan looks at you quizzically.)~
@152  = ~What awaits us, <CHARNAME>?~
@153  = ~Destruction is in the air. Do you feel it? We're all doomed.~ [O#XAN000]

@155  = ~I have nothing to say to you. Nothing whatsoever. Why do you keep bothering me?~ [O#XAN000]
@156  = ~(Xan turns to you.)~ [O#XAN000]
@157  = ~Do not ask me, <CHARNAME>: it is already too late to learn what you needed to know.~
@158  = ~What? Are you smoking? Oh, never mind. If you do, smoke as much as you want! It's not going to have time to affect you anyway.~
@159  = ~You look somewhat morose. Ironically, your suffering brings joy to many.~
@160  = ~Hmm? No, <CHARNAME>, I have nothing to tell you: my will is weakening even faster than yours.~
@161  = ~(He turns away from you and mutters to himself.)~
@162  = ~Children of Bhaal... Even their vilest sins lack originality.~
@163  = ~I wish I knew what is going to happen to you. But we are all limited in our ability to understand.~
@164  = ~You are farther and farther away from simply being human. (sigh) I wish the fundamental root of your character was unassailable mediocrity.~
@165  = ~I've been thinking about our false friends. All those who pretended to offer a helping hand, but went for a dagger in the back in the end. Not only were they just pretending to like you, but they were not pretending nearly as hard as they could. Interesting, isn't it?~
@166  = ~What is it, <CHARNAME>? Dreaming of simple life? No. No, your last chance was yesterday.~
@167  = ~Don't tell me you are as full of overwhelming fear and that sensation of worthlessness as I am. You can't be.~
@168  = ~You look troubled. Oh, but you wouldn't know inner peace even if it enveloped your entire life. Which it won't.~
@169  = ~Hmm? No, you have not even the remotest chance of going down in history, if you were going to ask that.~
@170  = ~I was wondering: how unique could your dreams possibly be? Do your siblings - those who are still alive, that is - dream, too? And if no - are you the Chosen One, then?~
@171  = ~Tired? Too bad for you.~
@172  = ~On the road to prosperity, happiness, and inner peace, one must seek certain signs. Guideposts for the soul on the path of enlightenment, if you will. I wish I could retrace my steps a few dozen years...~
@173  = ~Most people are probably happier than you and me. Or are they?~
@174  = ~(Xan silently clasps your hand.)~
@175  = ~Even at our best, we are still not very good. Will we survive? Will we?~
@176  = ~Death dogs our every step... or he would, if he could stand our malodorous stench. Bah! I need a bath.~
@177  = ~What are you thinking of this time? Killing? Just because you like it, doesn't mean you're good at it.~
@178  = ~Rather, you are too good... But you do not need to know that.~
@179  = ~<CHARNAME>... Imagine you won. Imagine you bested your siblings and took Bhaal's place. You'll... you'll cease to be human. You'll never be truly interested in anything ever again.~
@180  = ~"There are none so tired as those who will not sleep." When do we stop for rest?~
@181  = ~The end is nigh, my friend. The end is nigh.~
@182  = ~Do you know how few seconds it takes a master assassin to slip into a room and take deadly aim? Do realize how many times you've been on the receiving end?~
@183  = ~It is a miracle you are still standing here talking to me.~
@184  = ~What? You want to discuss our recent battle? (sigh) One thing I know: the better part of valor is not something you'll ever have to deal with.~
@185  = ~Thinking about your perspectives, are you? Well, running is technically your best option; but that's not saying much.~
@186  = ~I have this feeling that all my problems are grouped in my head. Waiting to hatch. Seldarine, it hurts...~
@187  = ~You know, although there is in fact much that you can do to avoid a terrible fate, I just know you're not going to do it.~
@188  = ~Eventually, it will occur to you that every interesting thing that's happened in your life actually happened to someone around you, and you just watched. Because it has just occurred to me.~
@189  = ~I have been thinking about your siblings. When they die - *if* they die... Will you be the only one left? Or are you doomed to die, too - to die last, but to die nevertheless?~
@190  = ~Ah, how lucky we are: we need not worry about the future. We live in interesting times.~
@191  = ~It seems to me that many strangers come knocking at your door, and every one of them is named Opportunity. Opportunity to die.~
@192  = ~You need to take time out and start enjoying life's tiny pleasures, since tiny pleasures are about all you've got left. You know this deep inside, don't you? We are doomed. We always were.~
@193  = ~Today, one of my wildest dreams has suddenly come true. Unfortunately, it was the one in which each of the demon's fangs had its own little shrieking face. Lucky me, I suppose.~
@194  = ~I have been thinking - again! - and I decided that your belief that you are a pawn in a much larger game is untrue. The game is not all that large.~
@195  = ~Be careful what you wish for today. You won't get it, regardless, but it is always a good idea to be careful.~
@196  = ~(Suddenly Xan smiles.)~
@197  = ~Yes, you are going to have a bad day today. But do not get disheartened, it will be better than tomorrow.~
@198  = ~Mmm. You are still around?~
@199  = ~Never mind, I was simply trying to crack a joke. It is good to see you again.~
@200  = ~(sigh) If you live a long life, it will be a remarkable testament to my self-control. What is it this time?~
@201  = ~Speaking of our last battle... Men may despise you, but the gods, they *loathe* you.~
@202  = ~Will you continue to be predictable, <CHARNAME>? Or are we taking a day off for a change?~
@203  = ~(sigh) I have a feeling that good things only come to those who aren't us.~
@204  = ~So! Demons and dragons and drow want your blood; do we continue?~
@205  = ~I have seen you in battle numerous times, and you are impressive, but what if your true gifts remain withered and obscure? Think on it, before your adventuring days are over.~
@206  = ~Mmm? No, <CHARNAME>... not now.~
@207  = ~(sigh) Do you remember Dynaheir? And Khalid? Some wounds never heal...~
@208  = ~If our bodies are temples, as some priests say, then mine is a temple of misery. But yours body is truly a temple... of Doom.~
@209  = ~Yes, your competence will be the stuff of legends... until they learn of that day in Athkatla.~
@210  = ~But no, I am not going to tell them.~
@211  = ~They say life imitates art. If so, I truly do not want to know the artist whose art our lives imitate.~
@212  = ~Do not tell me... We are off to fight somebody again. (sigh) Excellent. Hello, wailing and gnashing of teeth...~
@213  = ~You will find out soon and in an unpleasant fashion that, yes, your enemies are still around.~
@214  = ~Seldarine, why do you have to take such risks? Your guardian angel, if you ever had one, has just moments ago given up out of exhaustion.~
@215  = ~We can never experience catharsis, because suffering like ours cannot conceivably be duplicated - we'd have to watch our own life on the stage...~
@216  = ~These days, I feel like falling. And on the way down, I have plenty of time to consider how much it will hurt.~
@217  = ~Did you ever wonder what it would be like to dedicate your whole life towards something only to find out it was useless? Ultimate victory, or immortality? Maybe you should have.~
@218  = ~Your best effort will still fall short. Why bother, <CHARNAME>?~
@219  = ~Despair. Just despair.~
@220  = ~Doom outnumbers its opposite twenty to one. We are... doomed.~
@221  = ~Give up and die. No one will admire your persistence.~
@222  = ~You are, in a way, luckier than your enemies: they are daily vexed and assailed by a veritable ocean of idiocy which their comrades cannot even begin to perceive. Because they are idiots.~
@223  = ~Let us say, hypothetically, that it isn't too late...~
@224  = ~But it is.~
@225  = ~Even the most elaborate irony would fail in the face of your future. Despair, <CHARNAME>. Despair.~
@226  = ~Soon, our miseries shall end. In death.~
@227  = ~What are you trying to do now? To follow the commands of your heart? It is as noble as to obey dictates of dozen ancient kings, some of whom, I'm told, weren't even ravening warmongering psychopaths with a taste for blood and unholy dominion.~
@228  = ~Well, not completely, at any rate.~
@229  = ~I know, you were about to say "We will win". (sigh) Your boasts are like having the tallest gravestone in the cemetery: nobody there cares.~
@230  = ~Do you think you are happy? No. You are only as happy as your enemies allow you to be.~
@231  = ~The foundation of your hope is deluded joy. Completely deluded, at that.~
@232  = ~We are about to die. Considering the circumstances, you should be thankful.~
@233  = ~Problems? No, you don't have any problems that some time and effort can't make a hundred times worse.~
@234  = ~(sigh) No, those whom the gods love surely aren't you.~
@235  = ~Things just get worse and worse... Eventually they will get better - but not for you.~
@236  = ~What? Did you mean to say that we had happy times? If happiness were so great, you would probably remember it more clearly.~
@237  = ~<CHARNAME>, there's no need to share your plans with me. I am fully aware of them already: "Strike without mercy. Repeat as necessary."~
@238  = ~Do you know the greatest horror of a life after death? It is that you'll still have to live with yourself.~
@239  = ~<CHARNAME>... Cannot you think about anything else?~
@240  = ~Too bad your forte isn't something peaceful or painless.~
@241  = ~I already see our future. Especially yours. The years will not be kind to you, and the days will be even worse, but it's the endless minutes that'll really make you scream.~
@242  = ~I see the time for reason has long passed.~
@243  = ~Your silence is golden.~
@244  = ~And like gold, people will happily kill you to obtain it.~
@245  = ~Soon enough despair will permeate your dreams and your life with equal fullness, making each accelerating pendulum swing between waking and dreaming another iteration down the mirrored hall of madness.~
@246  = ~Ah, I see nerves. Yes, the sheer anxiety will set your nerves racing, your pulse pounding; your heart threatening to leap clear out of your chest. And while your nerves and pulse are self indulgent pansies, your heart is no longer one for idle threats.~
@247  = ~You could be crueler, but you'll never be cruel enough.~
@248  = ~Words have a life apart from their meaning; even a seemingly random pattern of unrelated words can evoke foreboding, nausea, and revulsion within a sensitive reader. Take, for example, names of your enemies...~
@249  = ~I have dreamt a fantastic dream of such harrowing immediacy and heartbreaking beauty that my waking life seems to be but a tired charade of cardboard cutouts and cut rate swordplay.~
@250  = ~Not that it isn't already.~
@251  = ~(sigh)~
@252  = ~You should really consider saving these sighs for the future.~
@253  = ~You cannot be killed by normal means, but then, your killers are hardly normal people.~
@254  = ~<CHARNAME>, isn't it time to leave me alone? Not that you're going to, of course.~
@255  = ~Today is the last day of the rest of our lives.~
@256  = ~I am still here, <CHARNAME>, awaiting your command. And rather tired of idle chatter, in case you haven't noticed.~
@257  = ~(yawn) Seldarine, I am tired.~
@258  = ~How are you? You look paler than usual, somehow.~
@259  = ~Take heart, my friend. We will either die today or tomorrow. Either way, our lives are pretty much set.~
@260  = ~Evereska... Will I see you again?~
@261  = ~(He nods at you politely.)~
@262  = ~Mmm?~
@263  = ~I don't think we have time to talk right now. We are about to die, you see.~
@264  = ~<CHARNAME>, I am sorry, but this is enough. We are at war! How many more do you think will die if we continue to stand and talk?~
@265  = ~I understand your reluctance to strike, but it is time to cease all conversation, pointless or not. Troubled times are upon us.~
@266  = ~My friend, I value your company, but now we truly have to go. The war awaits.~
@267  = ~(Xan raises his head.)~ [O#XAN000]
@268  = ~<CHARNAME>, dear... Are you all right?~
@269  = ~(He nods and continues walking.)~
@270  = ~Yes? You look especially lovely today, I should say.~
@271  = ~No, no, do not tell me... To battle again?~
@272  = ~It is funny, but every time you approach, I feel butterflies in my stomach.~
@273  = ~A copper for your thoughts? Or two. Or three. Or - all the gold in the world.~
@274  = ~Your eyes are asking for - a compliment? A kiss?~
@275  = ~Come here.~
@276  = ~(Xan frowns and looks away.)~
@277  = ~What is it? Wait... <CHARNAME>, are you well?~
@278  = ~(Xan takes a step in your direction and firmly takes your hand.)~
@279  = ~<CHARNAME>...~
@280  = ~Everything is all right, I trust? Ah, but with us, it never can be.~
@281  = ~Hmm? Is there something you require?~
@282  = ~(He looks sad, or perhaps it is a trick of the light. Then his smile widens, and any trace of sorrow is gone.)~
@283  = ~I wonder... look around, <CHARNAME>. Nothing you see is permanent. Then - how can we be?~
@284  = ~(In an achingly familiar gesture, Xan raises an eyebrow.)~
@285  = ~Yes?~
@286  = ~I missed you.~
@287  = ~You look troubled. But these are troubled times, aren't they?~
@288  = ~We'll talk, but later, if you can stand it. I have too much on my mind, none of it pleasant.~
@289  = ~Except you, of course.~
@290  = ~Yesterday, I dreamt of you in white. You looked fabulous.~
@291  = ~Ah, <CHARNAME> approaches, and I have not got even a single flower on me. A shame.~
@292  = ~Smile, <CHARNAME>. It becomes you.~
@293  = ~I feel bleak, somehow. And tired. Will this ever end?~
@294  = ~(yawn) Are we going to rest anytime soon, I wonder?~
@295  = ~I wish there was something I could do to ease this burden of yours. Perhaps holding you is not such a bad idea?~
@296  = ~How are you?~
@297  = ~We have each other, <CHARNAME>. We own the world.~
@298  = ~Is there anything left to desire, do you think? I have you, you - me, and together we have...~
@299  = ~Death. (sigh) Of course.~
@300  = ~We are still doomed... aren't we? Somehow, I doubt it.~
@301  = ~In the moments like these, when you approach me and I look you in the face, I almost want to pray. Seldarine knows, I've never been happier.~
@302  = ~<CHARNAME>... will you ever forgive me? For those black days...~
@303  = ~Will we ever know peace, you and I?~
@304  = ~(Xan bends over your hand and kisses it.)~
@305  = ~Anything of importance? I wonder if it can wait until next morning... hmm. Do you think it is time for rest?~
@306  = ~As lovely as always. My, but you are a sight for sore eyes.~
@307  = ~Mmm? Ah, it is you again.~
@308  = ~<CHARNAME>? Your hair... let me tuck a stray lock here...~
@309  = ~(He frowns, a scroll in his hands.)~
@310  = ~I am sorry, but... (Xan shrugs helplessly.)~
@311  = ~(His face lights up, and he kisses you on the cheek.)~
@312  = ~(He looks somewhere over your shoulder, deep in thought.)~
@313  = ~Mmm? Oh, I am sorry, I drifted away a little. An unforgivable sin with you around, I know.~
@314  = ~<CHARNAME>. <CHARNAME>...~
@315  = ~I shall never get tired of saying your name.~
@316  = ~(sigh) It is going to be a long, hard day. A kiss for luck?~
@317  = ~(Xan reaches out and takes you into his arms.)~
@318  = ~This is it. We are not going anywhere for an hour at least. Or two.~
@319  = ~(With surprising ease, Xan sweeps you off the ground and into his arms.)~
@320  = ~Now, here is an appropriate place for you.~
@321  = ~You are the most mysterious woman I have ever met, <CHARNAME>. I wonder, will I ever even come close to unraveling your mystery?~
@322  = ~(sigh) I believe I am doomed not to.~
@323  = ~It is so hot in here... or do I feel thus, because you are with me?~
@324  = ~Mmm? Lovely, we have a battle on our hands. Have you forgotten?~
@325  = ~To rest or not to rest - and that's the question. What do you think, dear?~
@326  = ~How lucky I am... Lucky indeed - I have a real you with me. This is certainly more than I deserve.~
@327  = ~Yes? Ah, <CHARNAME>. I bet you are about to share another reckless plan with me. Tell me, why is recklessness so attractive?~
@328  = ~This gear becomes you... but some simple silks would become you so... much... better...~
@329  = ~Excuse me, I have difficulty speaking for some reason.~
@330  = ~My lady <CHARNAME>. (Xan bows.)~
@331  = ~(His knuckles briefly touch yours.)~
@332  = ~I am tired beyond hope. Are you?~
@333  = ~Why the sad face, my dear? If you remember, this is my prerogative.~
@334  = ~You look lovely always. But today...~
@335  = ~(Xan leans in and plants a quick kiss on your lips.)~
@336  = ~(His hand brushes your cheek affectionately.)~
@337  = ~I am all ears, <CHARNAME>. Unless it is about Imoen.~
@338  = ~I wonder... with your beauty, what did your mother look like?~
@339  = ~But forgive me; forgive me.~
@340  = ~What is it again? Do you miss my long rants? We will speak soon, I promise.~
@341  = ~<CHARNAME>, much as I value your affection, wouldn't it be wiser to pay more attention to our surroundings?~
@342  = ~Shall I kiss you now? Or later? Yes, I think... later.~
@343  = ~Ah, <CHARNAME>. As ever, you are a sight for sore eyes. Always.~
@344  = ~I have been thinking of you, and here you are.~
@345  = ~(His smile becomes wider.)~
@346  = ~Amazing, don't you think?~
@347  = ~I feel dangerously close to giving you pet names, so we'd better keep a distance for some time. You do not want to hear all sorts of words starting with 'sugar', do you?~
@348  = ~I wonder if I will ever kiss your hand and call you my wife. I hope so...~
@349  = ~We are so... together now. Astounding.~
@350  = ~I... love you, <CHARNAME>.~
@351  = ~Melamin, time flies. We have a destination; we mustn't dawdle.~
@352  = ~Although a little is not that bad, is it...~
@353  = ~(He takes you in his arms and gives you a long, deep, probing kiss.)~
@354  = ~(He nods at you coolly, and returns to his scrolls.)~
@355  = ~(He raises an eyebrow.)~
@356  = ~Hmm?~
@357  = ~Dream or reality? Ah, neither, I see. It is <CHARNAME>.~
@358  = ~I've been thinking... <CHARNAME> of Evereska becomes you much more than <CHARNAME> of Candlekeep.~
@359  = ~Do you see this gold piece? In centuries, it will fade, crumble, be lost and forgotten. But I... I have a strange feeling we will not. Do you believe me?~
@360  = ~Gorion would have been proud of you. But you know this.~
@361  = ~I wonder how are Semaj and Angelo, these days? You know, with Sarevok turning up, it's likely we will meet them, too.~
@362  = ~Little one...~
@363  = ~(He blows you a kiss and immediately turns away, as if embarrassed.)~
@364  = ~Mmm? Yes, I am happy to see you, too. Shall we go now?~
@365  = ~(sigh) Yes, <CHARNAME>, I am still here. Surprised?~
@366  = ~Should I try and persuade you to let go of me for a second, I wonder? <CHARNAME>, I have to prepare my spells, above all.~
@367  = ~Melamin... are you well? Come here.~
@368  = ~Life is so...~
@369  = ~... beautiful.~
@370  = ~I missed you, <CHARNAME>. How I missed you...~
@371  = ~The Five, Melissan's tasks, local matters, bounty notices - what does it matter, when Xan is around!~
@372  = ~(sigh) I value your attention. More than anything else in this world. But not before the war is over, or at least, not in such quantities.~
@373  = ~(Silently, he draws you close, and starts rocking you like a child - a little.)~
@374  = ~(Xan does not say anything: his eyes are firmly fixed on your cleavage. Caught in the act, he coughs and reluctantly, very slowly, averts his head.)~
@375  = ~(He lets out a slow, content sigh and squeezes your hands.)~
@376  = ~Ah! Here you are. <CHARNAME>, we have to discuss our battle plans. Urgently and immediately.~
@377  = ~Will we... stop for rest? Simply for the sake of discussing battle plans, of course. Without a doubt, you understand.~
@378  = ~A walk? Just the two of us? Come.~
@379  = ~(He strokes your left arm with his fingers, up and down until your skin starts to shiver.)~
@380  = ~Beautiful.~
@381  = ~(His eyes shine, his lips eagerly part to meet yours, and he pulls you into his arms with surprising emotion.)~
@382  = ~(The next few minutes are a blur. But a very, very satisfying one.)~
@383  = ~(He looks down on your hands.)~
@384  = ~I would like to put a ring on this finger... some day. If we both survive this.~
@385  = ~I love you. Again and again.~
@386  = ~<CHARNAME>. My beautiful <CHARNAME>... I am going to break two hearts, but I will say that: we have no time. We must go. To war. Yes, really.~
@387  = ~Dearest... I adore you. But we have to end this war. I know you do not want to. I do not want to, either. But we must. Come.~
@388  = ~<CHARNAME>, that's enough, and I mean it this time. Come, we have a lot to do today.~
@389  = ~What is it?~ [O#XAN000]
@390  = ~Nothing. Let us continue our travels.~
@391  = ~Xan, could we be friends, you and I?~
@392  = ~I want us to be together, Xan.~
@393  = ~Very well.~
@394  = ~Friends? You have mastered cruel irony, <CHARNAME>. (sigh) Or, rather, I did. No.~
@395  = ~I believe so. Yes, you have my friendship.~
@396  = ~We will talk. Soon.~
@397  = ~<CHARNAME>, not so long ago you sent me away. And you were right: there was nothing I could give you. A coward I was, and a coward I'll stay. I am sorry.~
@398  = ~I was asked to pass these words to you: "This is a dark time for us all. But there is hope."~
@399  = ~We kick up dust
When we walk,
And when we sleep our skin sloughs off,
In time our nails, our hair.~
@400  = ~Life is fighting an amusing little scrap
Against death, who holds back her paw a moment,
Scorns majestically - 
Then the blow.~
@401  = ~We are deluding ourselves.~
@402  = ~But when first you came into my arms - 
Sweet folly! All the wisdom in this world
That apprehends we are fools,
are doomed,
are wandering about beneath a glass
are winding down our clockwork hearts - 
Oh folly!~
@403  = ~That was more sweet to me than knowledge sure,
Than the security
Of a sealed coffin.~
@404  = ~When my eyes were dazzled by your vulnerable pink - 
I equally ridiculous - 
Stripped of airs, of graces - 
Naked and laughing.
And I knew.~
@405  = ~I knew.~
@406  = ~(Xan's dark eyes rest on you, and, for once, something hopeful shimmers in their depth.)~ [O#XAN000]
@407  = ~(Hug Xan)~
@408  = ~(Smile at Xan)~
@409  = ~(Lean on Xan)~
@410  = ~Is there something I can do for you?~
@411  = ~I cannot believe we are together again...~
@412  = ~(Squeeze Xan's hand)~
@413  = ~(Eye Xan)~
@414  = ~Do you know how I feel about you?~
@415  = ~Xan, what are your plans for this eve, hmm?~
@416  = ~(Jump at Xan)~
@417  = ~I am going to do something highly inappropriate...~
@418  = ~(Kiss Xan)~
@419  = ~(Wait for his reaction)~
@420  = ~Let us talk.~
@421  = ~(Do nothing)~
@422  = ~(Xan watches you settling into his arms with a mildly amused smile.) Ah, <CHARNAME>, <CHARNAME>...~
@423  = ~(He leans in to you, so his cheek touches yours, and his hair tickles your eyes, and sighs. Whether it was a hopeful or a forlorn sigh, you do not know, but a small smile, hiding in the corner of his mouth, gives you some clue...)~
@424  = ~(His arms feel unusually warm, so much that you quickly grow hot in his embrace. Xan steps back immediately.)~
@425  = ~Mmm. Perhaps I should conjure some ice again... don't you think?~
@426  = ~(His arms twine around your waist, and all of a sudden you feel as if you were in a peaceful spring forest somewhere around Candlekeep. The rustle of leaves surrounds you, the air is sweet with familiar scents, and next to you stands Xan as you saw him for the first time over a year ago.)~
@427  = ~(You blink, and the illusion is shattered. Xan, however, remains, and while your surroundings are less peaceful, the lingering embrace that follows is no less warm and pleasant.)~
@428  = ~(Xan draws you close and drapes an arm about your shoulders.)~
@429  = ~I was about to seek your company, as well.~
@430  = ~Oh, <CHARNAME>. Why, I am flattered beyond measure.~
@431  = ~(You do not realize how exactly it happens, but suddenly you are lifted in the air, until you sit firmly perched on his shoulder, in full battle gear. Xan sighs, almost happily, and embraces your knees.)~
@432  = ~Sometimes I wish I could do it more often.~
@433  = ~(Xan sighs despondently, but seems to cheer up slightly, as your arms find their way around his neck. He slowly turns his head left and right to feel your touch there, and closes his eyes.)~
@434  = ~(You settle into each other's arms, Xan's breath gently caressing your face and hair.)~
@435  = ~(Next moment, he abruptly lets you go and hurriedly reaches for his spell components. Doubtlessly some shadow or the other broke your rare moment of leisure yet again.)~
@436  = ~(With elven grace you step close to Xan, and he responds in the same manner. Your embrace resembles an elegant dance: very close, the two of you move slowly, every gesture full of finesse and tenderness at the same time. The Elven Spirit envelops you, and in moments, you forget about time as if it never existed.)~
@437  = ~(Xan presses you very close and covers you with his cloak. Under it, you stand in silence, and slowly, you start feeling his body as strongly as you feel yours. A needle of pain in his - or your - left temple, a warm sensation in your chest, and a subtle, very well concealed, feeling of tenderness inside.)~
@438  = ~(Xan raises an eyebrow and shakes his head.)~
@439  = ~<CHARNAME>, please! This is hopeless.~
@440  = ~Though... perhaps not entirely.~
@441  = ~(Xan snorts and crosses his arms.) No, my dearest. Not in this lifetime.~
@442  = ~(Xan's eyes follow you long after you have stopped smiling.)~
@443  = ~(A hesitant smile appears on his face.)~
@444  = ~Well, perhaps. Perhaps.~
@445  = ~Why would you wish to see a doomed man's smile, <CHARNAME>? What would you stand to gain?~
@446  = ~Unless... unless you wish to see it as fervently as I - a smile of one certainly doomed woman.~
@447  = ~(On cue, Xan smiles sadly.)~
@448  = ~(sigh) Sometimes I think you will die smiling...~
@449  = ~(Xan sighs, but obediently smiles back.)~
@450  = ~Truly, I missed this sight...~
@451  = ~(His eyes shine, so brightly that you are momentarily taken aback. This wide, beaming smile cannot possibly belong to the Xan you know.)~
@452  = ~(And it no longer does. In a flash, Xan's face sinks into its usual gloominess again.)~
@453  = ~(Xan gently turns until your head rests on his shoulder, and his hands settle in front of you.)~
@454  = ~I could stand like this until nightfall, I suppose. Or the sunrise. Or the next sunset. Or - ~
@455  = ~<CHARNAME>, we do not truly need to go anywhere, do we?~
@456  = ~(Xan is standing very still. Perhaps it is for the fear that you will suddenly leave, but it seems he has stopped to breathe, even. Then, very slowly, he inhales, and gingerly touches your cheek, brushing away some stray wisps. He whispers something then, but so quietly you barely hear a word. Somehow, however, it bears little resemblance with 'doom'.)~
@457  = ~(Xan does not react at first. Then all of a sudden he squeezes you into a tight embrace and starts to cover your face and neck with brief, fleeting kisses, his breath dry and hot.)~
@458  = ~(He coughs and draws away, looking apologetic.)~
@459  = ~I do not know what came over me. I thought it was the last time for you and I, and... I could not stand it.~
@460  = ~(Xan kisses your hair and places his palms on your shoulders, massaging them.)~
@461  = ~(Accidentally Xan leans on you in turn, apparently weary. He immediately jumps back, horrified, but once again his robes get in the way, and he hopelessly tumbles down, dragging you with him.)~
@462  = ~(The ground is far from soft, but Xan's body is softer, so your landing is safe. His is likely not, however, and a quiet groan confirms your suspicions.)~
@463  = ~(Still lying on the ground, Xan sighs hopelessly and looks up at you.)~
@464  = ~Well. This was quite some adventure. Next time will likely end in my death, I suppose. <CHARNAME>, why would you wish it so?~
@465  = ~(Xan shifts slightly to make you more comfortable.)~
@466  = ~Oh!~ [O#XAN016]
@467  = ~Ah, it's you again.~
@468  = ~(sigh) Come here.~
@469  = ~(Xan sighs and steps closer without a word. He looks too sad and forlorn for such an activity, however, and within moments, he steps back and silently urges you to proceed.)~
@470  = ~(Xan gently takes you by the shoulders and turns, so you stand face to face.)~
@471  = ~How I love to love <CHARNAME>...~
@472  = ~(Xan looks at you reproachfully.)~
@473  = ~To get yourself some better equipment? I would not say 'no' to some extra protection, either. But your safety is above all, now, today and forever.~
@474  = ~I... do not know.~
@475  = ~Kiss me?~
@476  = ~Well. Your admirers have desisted - or have they? We are together now, I suppose... I hope. You are in no less danger... and I am no less doomed...~
@477  = ~No, <CHARNAME>. I need nothing, since nothing has changed.~
@478  = ~(Xan smiles slightly.) But you already did.~
@479  = ~You are alive, and you are here - what else can I wish for?~
@480  = ~For this impossible idyll to last, of course.~
@481  = ~Dearest...~
@482  = ~Come here.~
@483  = ~I...~
@484  = ~Forgive me. I have done so much wrong, to you and to myself both... I look forward to the time when these mistakes are buried, and I will no longer fear stumbling on them again.~
@485  = ~This world is a haven of sorrow, but a chosen few live to see the light. I pray you shall be one of them, <CHARNAME>.~
@486  = ~Unless, of course, you will be spying this light from a pedestal forever beyond my reach.~
@487  = ~No, <CHARNAME>. What can I do for you?~
@488  = ~Just let me concentrate. A battle comes, and words are of no more use.~
@489  = ~Neither can I... but one look at you relinquishes my doubts.~
@490  = ~Incredible. Is it not?~
@491  = ~It is a miracle that comes alive for me every hour, day and night.~
@492  = ~(Xan sighs and buries his face in your hair.)~
@493  = ~Yes...~
@494  = ~Are we truly?~
@495  = ~So many sad memories... and so few joyful ones.~
@496  = ~I am sure this is impossible, but I will do my best to change it.~
@497  = ~(sigh) I am too unused to happiness, <CHARNAME>.~
@498  = ~(Wordlessly, Xan gathers you in his arms and does not let go of you for a long, long time.)~
@499  = ~I know. But we will get used to it. I promise.~
@500  = ~I do not know what to do. Should I abandon all hope, and wait for your death or mine, or should I start...~
@501  = ~(Xan stops abruptly and turns away.)~
@502  = ~(Xan takes your hand gently in his.)~
@503  = ~(Xan winces and gives you a reproachful look.)~
@504  = ~(Xan jumps, startled, but his face softens as he sees you.)~
@505  = ~(Xan slowly raises your hand to his lips and kisses your palm.)~
@506  = ~Your beautiful, beautiful hands...~
@507  = ~(Xan raises an eyebrow, but gives your hand a brief squeeze.)~
@508  = ~(Xan looks at you, and his face lights up. You proceed arm in arm.)~
@509  = ~(Xan gives you a grateful smile.)~
@510  = ~(When your hand withdraws, something is different.)~
@511  = ~(You open your palm. A small flower lies there, dry and fragrant.)~
@512  = ~(Xan watches you with a small smile on his face.)~
@513  = ~It is a flower of hope, cormamin.~
@514  = ~(Xan's fingers gently lace with yours, warm and soft.)~
@515  = ~(Xan shifts uncomfortably and pulls his robes tighter around him.)~
@516  = ~(His gait is slightly unsteady, and he winces more often than he normally does. Noticing your gaze, Xan politely makes way for you. You note that he desperately tries to hide the injury, biting his lower lip every time he stumbles.)~
@517  = ~(His slim build attracts the eye, and while his thin, flowing robes do not reveal more than they should, it is still a promising sight.)~
@518  = ~(Xan sends you a bemused look over the shoulder.) <CHARNAME>, what on earth were you just thinking about?~
@519  = ~(Xan's walk is fast and sharp, his hair flying from left to right, and his moonblade swaying precariously. Finally, he makes a large step, and you hear his robes tearing, the blade flowing through them effortlessly.)~
@520  = ~(Xan stops, desperately trying to close the tear and to roll his eyes at the same time.)~
@521  = ~<CHARNAME>, kindly avert your eyes, if you please.~
@522  = ~(Before you finally do, there is quite an eyeful your eyes grab, however.)~
@523  = ~(Xan coughs uncomfortably.)~
@524  = ~<CHARNAME>, what is it that draws your attention? I'd say that in your case, a mirror is a more worthy object of... consideration.~
@525  = ~(Xan walks with his head down, lost in his thoughts. His left arm hangs limply, but his right hand traces patterns in the air, small sparkles following his fingers.)~
@526  = ~(You watch, your mind subconsciously trying to decipher the patterns. These are elven runes; old, but plain for any to see. "A - mael - amin".)~
@527  = ~(Xan raises his head, and his dark eyes meet your intent gaze. For a moment, he looks confused. Then his gaze takes the same force, drinking in your image so fiercely you feel uncovered all of a sudden.)~
@528  = ~(It ends as abruptly as it begins, and you both turn away, him looking somewhat abashed for long afterwards.)~
@529  = ~(Xan scratches his chin, frowning. He stops and consults with his spellbook, and frowns even more heavily. Then, all of a sudden, he blushes to the tips of his ears, drops his spellbook to the ground and swiftly walks away.)~
@530  = ~(You pick up his spellbook. It is open on a page where only one spell is scribed. It is named "Wizard Eye".)~
@531  = ~(For a short while now, Xan does his best to avoid your gaze. Very slowly, you shift position until you can spy him unobstructed, and notice...)~
@532  = ~(A single tear running down his cheek.)~
@533  = ~(Xan walks next to you, smiling to his thoughts. He notices your gaze and coughs, trying but failing to chase this smile of his from his face. In the end he sighs, obviously defeated by his sudden good mood, and offers you his hand.)~
@534  = ~(He shakes his head.)~
@535  = ~Tell me.~
@536  = ~I love you.~
@537  = ~I hate you.~
@538  = ~I like you a lot.~
@539  = ~I am mad at you.~
@540  = ~Not at this lifetime.~
@541  = ~It is too difficult to describe.~
@542  = ~You say so now, but what will you answer in a moment? In an hour? In a day?~
@543  = ~(He smiles wryly.)  No, do not answer. After all, neither of us seems to have any choice. We are doomed to be slaves of our emotions.~
@544  = ~Something... pleasant?~
@545  = ~I am doomed to ever be guessing it, it seems.~
@546  = ~I do not know. But do you?~
@547  = ~You are beautiful when you cock your head like that.~
@548  = ~Love, dislike, fear, lust, hatred, surprise, tenderness, confusion, amusement and kinship - and there are many more. You feel all of these at different times, <CHARNAME>.~
@549  = ~(Xan gives you a small, fond smile.)~
@550  = ~I have hopes I do, yes.~
@551  = ~Strange, most likely. (sigh) Much as I do.~
@552  = ~I do not know... but perhaps you will forgive me some day.~
@553  = ~Mmm? Dare I imagine... ?~
@554  = ~Oh.~
@555  = ~(He peers at you suspiciously.)~
@556  = ~My plans? I'd like to know your plans... ah. That.~
@557  = ~We'll... talk about it later. If you wish to.~
@558  = ~None whatsoever. Yours?~
@559  = ~Oh, Seldarine, why did I ask this last question...~
@560  = ~I will study my spellbook, as always. And no, there's no need to give me that look. I know what it means only too well.~
@561  = ~Why, <CHARNAME>, your intonation gives me all sorts of ideas...~
@562  = ~(Xan raises an eyebrow quizzically.) And... you have something to offer?~
@563  = ~I do not see any sense in making plans, <CHARNAME>. We'll likely be dead before nightfall.~
@564  = ~What for? Life is hollow, you know.~
@565  = ~<CHARNAME>, you imp, what is your intent?~
@566  = ~Why? Do you require... my company?~
@567  = ~Or something else?~
@568  = ~(Xan bends and kisses you on the lips.)~
@569  = ~I suppose you have my answer.~
@570  = ~Aaah!~
@571  = ~Oh. Ah... <CHARNAME>, don't.~
@572  = ~(Xan rolls on the ground immediately. Noticing it is only you, he immediately jumps on his feet, throughly embarrassed.)~
@573  = ~(Xan pushes you out of the way immediately and reaches for his sword.)~
@574  = ~No enemy... but who?~
@575  = ~<CHARNAME>. You will get us killed one day, mark my words.~
@576  = ~(Catching you just in time, Xan immediately embraces you and kisses your cheek.)~
@577  = ~Don't go.~
@578  = ~(Xan deftly catches you in the air.)~
@579  = ~So, what are you going to do now? You do not have many alternatives, you know.~
@580  = ~(He draws you close and kisses thoroughly, never missing a single spot on your face.)~
@581  = ~And even fewer now. I would say you are doomed to remain here for a long (he kisses you again), long time.~
@582  = ~Hmm? <CHARNAME>, no! My spell - ~
@583  = ~(Too late. You run into him with full force, and his spell misses its target and envelops the pair of you, instead.)~
@584  = ~(Suddenly, despite any and all spell protections that you wear, you miss your voice. Xan opens his mouth with an amused smile... and his arm darts to his throat, his smile replaced by the look of extreme horror.)~
@585  = ~(Soon, however, the problem is forgotten: while you cannot speak, there are only too many other things you can do... and the spell's duration is long indeed.)~
@586  = ~(Xan fails to catch you this time, and is thrown on the ground with you in his arms. He does not seem at all disappointed, having embraced you just above your knees: on the contrary,  he looks quite entranced with the view.)~
@587  = ~(Xan falls awkwardly with a shriek, and passes out.)~
@588  = ~(Within minutes, you bring him back. A healing potion helps his broken wrist in no time; still, he gives you a hurt look as he stands up, and does not seem to be in the mood to approach you any time soon.)~
@589  = ~(Xan kisses you as you land in his arms. His eyes shine with a rare light you cannot recognize at first... but when you look closer, you see it: two images of yourself, reflecting in his eyes a hundred times sharper than ever.)~
@590  = ~(Xan pointedly turns away, but somehow manages to catch you. You stand long in an embrace, his fingers gliding along your back, and his lips whispering words in Elven to you.)~
@591  = ~(gulp) <CHARNAME>, is this really necessary?~
@592  = ~(Xan throws a furtive look around and drags you in a secluded corner.)~
@593  = ~I suppose I am listening... ?~
@594  = ~Not that I am disinterested, ah, quite the contrary - but won't you wait until tonight?~
@595  = ~(You proceed, and Xan's eyes go round in no time.)~
@596  = ~<CHARNAME>, while... while you still haven't... robbed me of my breath and mind both... stop it, please.~
@597  = ~Yes?~
@598  = ~I meant 'no'! No!!~
@599  = ~Ah... <CHARNAME>...~
@600  = ~(Xan passes out.)~
@601  = ~Not before...~
@602  = ~(Xan sweeps you in his arms and kisses you on the lips.)~
@603  = ~Not before we are alone, safe and ready to rest, dearest. Or did you expect me to say something else?~
@604  = ~(Xan tries to speak, but breaks, tries to draw breath, but seems unable to, and shakes his head, instead.)~
@605  = ~(Xan steps back carefully.)~
@606  = ~Mmm? Oh, I am intrigued.~
@607  = ~(Xan answers your kiss eagerly, pressing you so tightly against him that you can hear his mad heartbeat. You could swear that for a moment, it stopped entirely... and then continued to beat faster than you thought possible.)~
@608  = ~(Xan breaks from your lips with an expression of longing on his face, and sighs.)~
@609  = ~Soon, I swear, I will forget my own name with you.~
@610  = ~(Xan gingerly touches your lips with his, as if he was afraid you would change your mind. Then the tension grows, until no force in the world, it would seem, might part you two.)~
@611  = ~(There is just such a force, however. A sound comes from nearby, and Xan abruptly steps back, loosing his fingers for casting. You move on, the taste still on your lips and the memory - in his eyes.)~
@612  = ~(Xan sighs, but steps closer to you. His hand brushes your cheek, and his other arm drapes around your shoulders, drawing you close, into an embrace that is doomed to fail...)~
@613  = ~(The last thought is not yours, and you shake your head in confusion. Xan looks as baffled as you are, and has hard time as he tries not to chuckle, his mouth a thin line.)~
@614  = ~(In the end, he waves his hand hopelessly, and your lips finally lock. You kiss until you are both out of breath, and Xan's eyes, which somehow look darker and deeper than usual, say he does not mind in the least.)~
@615  = ~<CHARNAME>, this is not the time...~
@616  = ~But...~
@617  = ~Oh, to hells with it. Come here.~
@618  = ~(Xan looks at you warily.)~
@619  = ~What is it you - ~
@620  = ~('Want', he tries to whisper helplessly, but only succeeds to half-open his lips before they find yours. For the next minute, he looks as he does not have the slightest inclination to speak.)~
@621  = ~Mmm - <CHARNAME> - I don't th - ~
@622  = ~(sigh)~
@623  = ~(Xan shakes his head firmly.)~
@624  = ~When we are alone. Then...~
@625  = ~I cannot believe it is actually happening...~
@626  = ~(He smiles as your lips meet, his expression blissful and content.)~
@627  = ~<CHARNAME>...~
@628  = ~(Xan kisses you briefly on the cheek and sighs.)~
@629  = ~Come. I feel it is time to die.~
@630  = ~(Xan walks next to you, seemingly unaware of your presence.)~ [O#XAN000]
@631  = ~Hey, how are you?~
@632  = ~I feel depressed. Maybe it is your influence, eh?~
@633  = ~It is tough to be a god, don't you think?~
@634  = ~Let us celebrate! Right here!~
@635  = ~We are still alive. Surprised?~
@636  = ~Xan, are we friends?~
@637  = ~Should I ask you for advice, I wonder?~
@638  = ~I wonder if a certain member of our party fancies me...~
@639  = ~Which weapon do you think suits me most?~
@640  = ~Do I look fat in my battle gear?~
@641  = ~I guess I drank too much yesterday...~
@642  = ~Me? I am about to die, as it happens. Either from exhaustion, or from the wounds I will doubtlessly receive in seconds. One... two...~
@643  = ~Oh, I will manage, however poorly. You'd better look after yourself.~
@644  = ~I am well... my friend. Thank you.~
@645  = ~My head hurts. How am I supposed to recite spells for hours on end? The next battle will be my last.~
@646  = ~I do not think I feel anything. Boredom, perhaps. And you?~
@647  = ~(snort) It may well be, yes.~
@648  = ~Depression, you say? Reason, more like.~
@649  = ~I am sorry, but there is little I can do. Perhaps this sister of yours... Imoen... (sigh) But no; forgive me.~
@650  = ~Do not concern yourself. Soon it will all be irrelevant.~
@651  = ~My influence? Why would you think so, I wonder?~
@652  = ~A god? Why would you...~
@653  = ~Oh. Excuse me.~
@654  = ~You have many more chances to die. So yes, I quite agree.~
@655  = ~I do not know, <CHARNAME>. Do I look like one?~
@656  = ~Perhaps, perhaps. Are you considering... godhood?~
@657  = ~Not tougher than getting drunk from time to time, as a certain Bhaalspawn does.~
@658  = ~Ah... er...~
@659  = ~No?~
@660  = ~(gulp) <CHARNAME>, I suggest this is not the place for drunken orgies. Not after the *last* time, at least.~
@661  = ~Oh. Well, since we're all doomed... why not?~
@662  = ~Celebrate *what*, precisely? Our inevitable demise?~
@663  = ~Oh, what would be the point? Other than a quick death, it grants nothing.~
@664  = ~Rather. Knowing you, I should have known...~
@665  = ~Not for long, I assure you.~
@666  = ~Well... a little. But do not think I will change my mind about our future. This is *not* going to happen.~
@667  = ~Not in the least. We are doomed, and our chances to die are now higher than ever. Be prepared.~
@668  = ~I believe in you. But the danger runs high, still.~
@669  = ~We are.~
@670  = ~You are a better friend than me, however.~
@671  = ~I suppose so. Why?~
@672  = ~Yes. Of course. Is there something you require?~
@673  = ~We are... and I almost regret our travels together are coming to an end.~
@674  = ~No, you are my worst enemy. (sigh) <CHARNAME>, if you know the answer, why ask?~
@675  = ~You know what kind of advice you are likely to get, don't you?~
@676  = ~I wouldn't. But who am I to advise you?~
@677  = ~You roll your dice, and you take your chances.~
@678  = ~(Xan snorts.) And then you die. Continue playing dice with the Fates, <CHARNAME>, and you are doomed.~
@679  = ~We need to find a safer place than this, that's for certain.~
@680  = ~Advice? Besides getting away from here as soon as possible? Do you think you *really* need some other advice? Run!~
@681  = ~And if the answer is yes, what is the point? I see none.~
@682  = ~I would be wary if I were you. The Bhaalspawn wars leave no place for love in between.~
@683  = ~I don't know, <CHARNAME>. Curiously enough, I never asked myself about anyone's feelings. (sigh) Perhaps I am getting old...~
@684  = ~(snort) Undoubtedly.~
@685  = ~(Xan rolls his eyes.)~
@686  = ~Why don't you ask this person yourself?~
@687  = ~A shield. A very large one.~
@688  = ~Boots of Speed. Trust me on this.~
@689  = ~You are doomed regardless of your choice, <CHARNAME>.~
@690  = ~Especially since the best of weapons are usually found in very dangerous places...~
@691  = ~Your current weapon is good enough. Without caution, however, it is naught but dead weight.~
@692  = ~(Xan smiles wryly.)~
@693  = ~Some staffs of the Magi make their users invisible. I doubt it will help you, though: your enemies seem to find you everywhere.~
@694  = ~I do not have the slightest notion as to what I should answer, so I won't.~
@695  = ~Perhaps. Have you tried asking someone else?~
@696  = ~I wouldn't say so, no.~
@697  = ~You need it to survive, not to look slim. I'd stop worrying about your looks and start worrying about your chances, instead.~
@698  = ~Ah, <CHARNAME>. You know you look well enough, and for a certain young man you are the most beautiful woman in the world. There is no need whatsoever for you to converse with me about it.~
@699  = ~Not more than usual, I would say. Though your 'usual' would send a lesser man straight to the grave.~
@700  = ~Obviously so. Have you tried looking in the mirror for a change?~
@701  = ~You were drunk, and it says it all. (sigh) We're doomed.~
@702  = ~It is hopeless to talk to you about it, anyway.~
@703  = ~I was not impressed with your behavior, if you mean this.~
@704  = ~What about?~
@705  = ~Something. To take my mind off the grander things.~
@706  = ~Old times, new times. Everything changes so fast, doesn't it?~
@707  = ~Soon I will see Evereska with you. What is it like?~
@708  = ~Us, what else? I love you.~
@709  = ~What was it like for you after the events in Spellhold?~
@710  = ~Do you still have doubts about you and me?~
@711  = ~My dreams seem to have stopped at last.~
@712  = ~Back in the past, assassins were after me. Now, the whole armies are.~
@713  = ~So many die because of me...~
@714  = ~The end draws close. I am afraid, Xan.~
@715  = ~Finally, Irenicus rots in the Nine Hells.~
@716  = ~How does it feel to be an Archmage, Xan?~
@717  = ~I have been wondering... Will you enchant someone for me?~
@718  = ~You must miss Evereska more than ever, now that you have declined to leave.~
@719  = ~We have been friends long, and yet I know little about you.~
@720  = ~We are just *so* doomed!~
@721  = ~What does your moonblade think of me now?~
@722  = ~I have confidence I will claim my father's throne.~
@723  = ~How do you feel about Saradush?~
@724  = ~Something grand is in store for me. I can feel it.~
@725  = ~What do you think of Sarevok now?~
@726  = ~Has Sarevok truly reformed?~
@727  = ~Xan, I like you very much, but, please, stop flirting with me.~
@728  = ~Xan, if you wish to flirt with me again, you may do so.~
@729  = ~You talk too much. I would rather that you kept quiet for some time.~
@730  = ~Xan, I want to end our relationship.~
@731  = ~No, nothing.~
@732  = ~A Bhaalspawn, and a fine example of bad manners, at that.~
@733  = ~And so it comes to be... (sigh) I expected as much.~
@734  = ~As you wish it, <CHARNAME>. (sigh) Your word is indeed my command.~
@735  = ~I understand. It is an enormous strain for you, is it not? After all, Bhaalspawn or not, you are only a woman.~
@736  = ~'Only a woman', hmm? As opposed to being a strong man?~
@737  = ~I am. And it is hard for me sometimes.~
@738  = ~Quite. So, how about a story?~
@739  = ~<CHARNAME>... A rare man can survive half of your trials. You are stronger than perhaps any mortal. Still, a mortal is what you are.~
@740  = ~My dear. (sigh) I haven't got the slightest idea of how to entertain you, I admit. My adventures before meeting you were not... peaceful, so to say. And our adventures... well, you get the idea.~
@741  = ~I need not be entertained, Xan. I simply need somebody to talk to.~
@742  = ~Oh, any story will do. I am no stranger to gore and suffering.~
@743  = ~Forget about stories, then. Just talk to me.~
@744  = ~Well...~
@745  = ~Two years ago, before meeting you, I was on a mission in Tethyr. I now understand how many of my missions, and those of my colleagues, were connected with the Exiles, like my last one was; this one was no exception.~
@746  = ~An abandoned laboratory was found in the ruins of an ancient temple. I was to search for any records, diaries, or other... pieces of remembrance.~
@747  = ~My search was, of course, futile. Everything was torn in shreds and burnt, and no spell could restore a single scrap. The laboratory's former owner knew what he was doing.~
@748  = ~However, I found one thing.~
@749  = ~Among shards of glass and broken slabs of stone, covered in blood and sour-smelling liquids, a small purple bellflower grew. There was little sunlight, and no earth; no water, and the air was stale, but still, it found its way up even in these beaten and dead surroundings.~
@750  = ~There is life everywhere, <CHARNAME>. Life that makes everything worthwhile.~
@751  = ~Awww.~
@752  = ~I thought you'd compare the flower to me.~
@753  = ~Ah. Yes. What time is it? We really have to go.~
@754  = ~But for this flower to grow, how many have died?~
@755  = ~Thank you.~
@756  = ~Why didn't you tell me about this before?~
@757  = ~Yes, you... look quite distracted, I should say.~
@758  = ~It is hopeless. You excel in beauty, and you know it.~
@759  = ~(sigh) Indeed. Come, then.~
@760  = ~I cannot say.~
@761  = ~No, please... do not look down again. I won't be able to stand it. Smile... now, this is better.~
@762  = ~But come. Although... I would gladly to tell you a story or two, just to keep this look on your face. It is worth... everything.~
@763  = ~We did not know each other so well, and Sarevok's assassins haunted your every step. I doubted you'd have been interested in my biography. And later, you found out for yourself what Irenicus was like, and needed no reminder.~
@764  = ~Then talk, and I will listen. You know that you always have my ear, don't you?~
@765  = ~There are so many things that I would like to say to you...~
@766  = ~Yes. But this time, I want you to talk.~
@767  = ~Not always. Often you withdraw, and I cannot get a word out of you.~
@768  = ~But of course I do. And it is enough for me. Let us go.~
@769  = ~But of course. May I have your hand again?~
@770  = ~True enough. But I will not, this time. Here... you wanted a story, did you not?~
@771  = ~Come, then. We will walk and you will tell me everything that troubles you... or do you want me to talk, instead?~
@772  = ~No. Let us walk.~
@773  = ~Yes. I want to know more about you.~
@774  = ~Indeed. And yet you remain yourself.~
@775  = ~What is it supposed to mean?~
@776  = ~Do I?~
@777  = ~I suppose.~
@778  = ~And you as well.~
@779  = ~You have changed a lot, though.~
@780  = ~That your very being remains untainted, as does your radiance. But you know of your beauty well enough, do you not?~
@781  = ~You do.~
@782  = ~Old times, new times. Soon it will all end, and we will die - or live in peace. And yet, I feel a salty taste in my mouth when I think of old times. Of Beregost and Trademeet, of forests and camps, of you and me.~
@783  = ~... of Saradush and the forest of Mir, of you and me.~
@784  = ~You still have me. And I have you.~
@785  = ~True. I miss these times, too.~
@786  = ~Peace will bring better places and new opportunities.~
@787  = ~No, no, I have changed - or my thoughts did, I assure you. I cannot believe I was once such a fool that... But enough of this.~
@788  = ~For the better, I hope. I cannot believe I was once such a fool that... But enough of this.~
@789  = ~Indeed. But back then, we were mere mortals. Now, the whole world is watching.~
@790  = ~My sole consolation these days...~
@791  = ~Do you? I'd never have thought, given how much is at stake. I actually thought you were to claim it. That is...~
@792  = ~To you, yes.~
@793  = ~I keep picturing you a goddess and wondering if you will become one. If you do not mind cheap flattery, to me you already are - at times. But I do not dare to ask you this question. The choice is yours, as I said. And yet I keep wondering...~
@794  = ~Stop tormenting yourself. I will stay with you, whatever happens.~
@795  = ~I wonder, too.~
@796  = ~Yes, we will not be together for long.~
@797  = ~I hear you. Yet only the words that you will say in the end will matter.~
@798  = ~Forgive me; I did not mean to say your words are irrelevant now. They are not; they have incredible power over me. They will always have.~
@799  = ~Still, I will wait for the end.~
@800  = ~Evereska is home, and it says it all. It is not unlike Candlekeep - its libraries are boundless, and it feels as secure. Or did. My heart sometimes stops when I think of its eventual fate; and I never had any news from it for over half a year...~
@801  = ~It will be all right.~
@802  = ~Do you think it is in danger?~
@803  = ~Tell me more.~
@804  = ~So you say.~
@805  = ~It must be. Phaerimm, humans, orcs, even betrayers amongst our own kin are plotting against it. It is doomed, irrevocably doomed.~
@806  = ~Still, it is the most beautiful place in the world. Bridges, terraces, brooks, gardens, marble walls of our estate. And music, music and laughter in the air. <CHARNAME>... will you sing for me now?~
@807  = ~Sing?!~
@808  = ~But... I cannot sing...~
@809  = ~Very well... (start to sing)~
@810  = ~No, I will not.~
@811  = ~Why now, of all times?~
@812  = ~Oh, now I have gone and made a fool of myself yet again.~
@813  = ~I miss my home. And the first thing that comes on my mind, when I close my eyes, is laughter and songs of Evereska. Quiet, but affecting my poor heart deeply. And since your voice has an even greater power over me, which you know quite well... would you?~
@814  = ~I understand now. Then... (start to sing)~
@815  = ~Oh. I am sorry, <CHARNAME>. Then...~
@816  = ~(Xan pales and freezes, his eyes never leaving your face.)~
@817  = ~(As you finish, he utters a huge, heart-breaking sigh, and does not speak again for a long time.)~
@818  = ~It is just as well. I... do not know if I could stand it, with my city still so far away.~
@819  = ~Then this eve, if you do not change your mind, I will take you to Evereska in reverie, and soon, so soon, if the saga of our lives does not come to an abrupt finale, you will see it for real.~
@820  = ~And I you.~
@821  = ~And this is it?~
@822  = ~And... ?~
@823  = ~Phew... Finally!~
@824  = ~Good to hear it.~
@825  = ~Aren't we the happiest duo in the world.~
@826  = ~<CHARNAME>, I... feel awkward all of a sudden. Perhaps we should stop this conversation for now?~
@827  = ~Awkward? Why?~
@828  = ~As you wish, though I feel wonderful.~
@829  = ~Yes, let's. I admit I feel the same.~
@830  = ~Ah, <CHARNAME>... did you really have any doubt after our last conversation?~
@831  = ~(sigh) Aren't we just.~
@832  = ~Why is it so difficult for me to talk about it? I... I do not know.~
@833  = ~Oh - my feelings for you I do. It is just...~
@834  = ~Do you ever wake up with a realization that all is lost, all that you've desperately been clinging to for so long? Gone with no hope for reclaiming, and you are doomed to misery for the rest of your life?~
@835  = ~When I... acted... in Spellhold, every morning after I woke up feeling precisely like this. Nothing could change it, and it only got worse.~
@836  = ~And... and I still do. Now that I have you again, the feeling disappears within seconds of awakening - I recall your smile, your glance, or, if you are near, I simply turn my head, and all doubt disappears. Still, I am terrified that some day it will return.~
@837  = ~This is why it is awkward for me at times to speak of love.~
@838  = ~I understand.~
@839  = ~I hope that some day, your fears will go.~
@840  = ~Can't I drive the terror away?~
@841  = ~Oh. This is horrible!~
@842  = ~I am thankful. And...~
@843  = ~Perhaps. Some day. When you and I are in peace. Do you truly believe such a day will come?~
@844  = ~But I should not doubt you. You are the one who brings me hope, after all.~
@845  = ~But you can. And you do.~
@846  = ~Isn't it? Yes, I am terrible at raising your spirits, I'm afraid. You, however, are incredible at lifting mine.~
@847  = ~And I love you.~
@848  = ~I was near you all the time. Did you not notice the difference?~
@849  = ~No. I was absorbed in my own feelings.~
@850  = ~You are too good at concealing your emotions.~
@851  = ~I did, but I want to hear it from your lips, as well.~
@852  = ~Was there a difference?~
@853  = ~I more than understand. And all the time we could have been there for each other...~
@854  = ~(sigh) I am, at that.~
@855  = ~Then you will.~
@856  = ~There was.~
@857  = ~I do not have a gift of foresight, <CHARNAME>. When you changed - when you became the Slayer - I thought you were gone for good. Should anyone have told me that you would lose control only twice, I would have laughed in his face.~
@858  = ~I was watching you, intently rather than passionately. My desire retreated somewhere, together with all other emotions, I suppose. I was expecting the blow to fall. Every hour, every day... I was in so much agony over this. And perhaps you were, too: I never asked you. Were you?~
@859  = ~In agony? Yes, after you said it was over.~
@860  = ~I was resigned to my fate.~
@861  = ~Yes. I dreaded becoming the Slayer again.~
@862  = ~No, I took it remarkably in stride.~
@863  = ~(sigh) I could say that I am remorseful, then repeat it over and over again, but what would be the point?~
@864  = ~The most sensible attitude. Perhaps it helped you survive in the end.~
@865  = ~<CHARNAME>... I cannot imagine what it must have been like. I would have gone mad in your place.~
@866  = ~You did. And yet nobody could say it was painless.~
@867  = ~I will repeat again: I do not know what the future brings. But I have always stood and I will always stand by you. Whatever happens. This I promise.~
@868  = ~But I digress. Later, when we entered the Underdark, all my thoughts were dedicated to survival. We talked little; you remember.~
@869  = ~And on the surface... What was it like?~
@870  = ~I tried to talk to you again, but it was hopeless.~
@871  = ~You told me that all you felt was infatuation, and it had passed.~
@872  = ~I thought we were done then, so I switched to other tasks.~
@873  = ~I could not think about anything else but the loss of my soul.~
@874  = ~Imoen's fate and the battle against Bodhi kept me occupied then.~
@875  = ~And now you sound like me. But yes, it effectively was.~
@876  = ~I felt thus then. I withdrew from you at the time, and so did you.~
@877  = ~So did I. I was a little more than an automaton then: casting spells, eating, sleeping... I neither dreaded nor anticipated death, or my return to Evereska, or my parting from you. I simply took things as they were, without thinking.~
@878  = ~And rightfully so. I tried my best not to; these thoughts were too horrible, even for your sake.~
@879  = ~My heart nearly gave out when Bodhi announced she was an elf. She was looking at you with such hatred... I was sure we were all doomed.~
@880  = ~For a while I felt as if I was incapable of love completely; burned out. It passed, however, shortly before we entered Suldanessellar.~
@881  = ~I do not ever wish to feel like this again.~
@882  = ~And then, Suldanessellar. It was as if I awakened after a long, dark, fitful slumber. I saw your face and remembered what was at stake. And vowed once again in my heart that Irenicus would fall, even if I was to never see you again afterwards.~
@883  = ~And fall he did. But then we were in Hell.~
@884  = ~And then one more realization dawned: it will not be over for you.~
@885  = ~I could not leave you. Neither could I fight with myself any longer.~
@886  = ~Took your own sweet time, didn't you?~
@887  = ~I would rather you realized it earlier.~
@888  = ~And I am happy you did not.~
@889  = ~My heart sings to see thee, as well.~
@890  = ~Thank you for telling me all this.~
@891  = ~(sigh) Our past knows no "what ifs", <CHARNAME>. Though often I wish it did.~
@892  = ~Yes, it was quite a story, was it not?~
@893  = ~I can easily say the words you want to hear. That on remaining with you, I have no doubts... and perhaps I never had. And it will be the truth, as far as I am concerned.~
@894  = ~But I do have doubts. Whether we will have a peaceful life some day, away from the roads, whether we will survive through all this, and whether... whether you will want to remain with me in the end.~
@895  = ~Do you doubt me now?~
@896  = ~I have the same doubts about you.~
@897  = ~I do not want to waste away in some mansion, Xan.~
@898  = ~Of course, how could I have forgotten! We're all doomed.~
@899  = ~It would appear so.~
@900  = ~You do indeed, and I do not blame you in the slightest.~
@901  = ~If you see it thus... well. I do want a respite; a long one, perhaps - but you are right. With such power as the one we wield, no one will allow us to sit idle. And adventuring at your side has been... I never experienced anything better.~
@902  = ~(snort) <CHARNAME>, does teasing me bring you any perverse satisfaction? But indeed, you *are* right.~
@903  = ~I do not doubt my feelings, this much I can say. Doubt may come later, but I will always remember the moment I made my decision - final and for life. You should know this much. And, if I may ask... what about you?~
@904  = ~I have no doubts about my feelings.~
@905  = ~I will remain with you, for now.~
@906  = ~The memory of someone else is still fresh in my heart.~
@907  = ~Doubt preys on me daily. I do not know if we made the right decision.~
@908  = ~I... am glad.~
@909  = ~Every second of this 'now' is a second I treasure. So your answer is more welcome than you imagine.~
@910  = ~And you really think that you can move on from that?~
@911  = ~I do.~
@912  = ~I do not know.~
@913  = ~I do not see any point.~
@914  = ~(sigh) We never seem to have it simple, do we?~
@915  = ~I will be here for you, for as long as you need me.~
@916  = ~There are no right or wrong decisions; there are only choices. And a choice is only right if your heart welcomes it.~
@917  = ~So, my dear doubtful love, shall we move on? Doubt is not the enemy; but hesitation likely is.~
@918  = ~Have they truly? Ah, that's a relief. But how can you be so sure?~
@919  = ~I have been sleeping peacefully for a while now, since Irenicus' demise.~
@920  = ~I just know somehow.~
@921  = ~Perhaps the nightmares will start again, but for now, I am free.~
@922  = ~What does it mean? That you have gained control over your heritage? That nobody else spies you in your reverie? Or that the gods simply decided to look elsewhere?~
@923  = ~The Solar said that the gods could not interfere.~
@924  = ~Perhaps both. Perhaps neither.~
@925  = ~I am too powerful to be manipulated through my dreams any longer.~
@926  = ~Regardless, you are free. For a while now, I thought I would offer you to share our reverie, now that we are together once more. But there is no real need, is there? I no longer need to shelter you from any nightmares you might have, because you have none.~
@927  = ~But I would still like that.~
@928  = ~There is need. I want to share my reverie with you.~
@929  = ~There is no need, true. Why don't we invent one?~
@930  = ~Indeed, but thank you for your concern.~
@931  = ~To tell you the truth, I would not have liked this anyway.~
@932  = ~Perhaps some day they will resurface again. Then you will have your chance.~
@933  = ~Then... then your desire is the only real reason I need. Tonight?~
@934  = ~I will simply remain at your side as you rest, then. Unless you, ah... have other wishes?~
@935  = ~They are indeed. And we are so few...~
@936  = ~Oh my. We are doomed.~
@937  = ~Do you think we will manage?~
@938  = ~I am scared, Xan.~
@939  = ~All my companions are in great danger, including you.~
@940  = ~(sigh) You finally understand, don't you?~
@941  = ~<CHARNAME>, you are serious, are you not? Because if you start giggling yet again, I... I do not know what I'll do.~
@942  = ~We managed to dodge the assassins, yes. But an assassin in the midst of an attacking army is another thing entirely.~
@943  = ~And so am I. (sigh) A'maelamin, I will shelter you, no matter the price.~
@944  = ~And to think that I was about to leave you in Suldanessellar. Fool, such a fool...~
@945  = ~We cannot linger in the pocket plane indefinitely. Sooner or later, we will get out - and will be ambushed. You are the leader; do you have a plan? What precautions do you want us to take, what spells should I memorize?~
@946  = ~Invisibility is our best bet. We should not be discovered.~
@947  = ~We are powerful; powerful enough to wipe out their scouts. We will rely on our weapons.~
@948  = ~Brute force. There is no other way.~
@949  = ~We will scout and choose the safest path. Away from the slaughter.~
@950  = ~I will have to think about it.~
@951  = ~I fully agree. Take something extra with you: a ring, or a potion. I want you to be able to escape at all costs.~
@952  = ~(groan) You will doom us. Think, <CHARNAME>: how many fighters will you able to bring down in one go? Ten? Twenty? Fifty? There will be hundreds, and not one of them will hesitate to break your neck, or worse.~
@953  = ~I agree. Will you let me conjure a scout for you?~
@954  = ~Do so. I will do likewise.~
@955  = ~But you look drawn, and sad. Or is it a trick of the light again? Regardless, I feel you need some extra rest. I do, too, to tell you the truth.~
@956  = ~Very well, rest it is. As soon as we find a proper spot...~
@957  = ~Not now.~
@958  = ~I do not think I will fall asleep any time soon.~
@959  = ~I am fine, truly. Will you manage a few more hours?~
@960  = ~Just hold me, and it will get better.~
@961  = ~(sigh) If by 'proper spot' you mean 'assassin-free', you will have to search for a very long time.~
@962  = ~As you wish. Collapsing from exhaustion is a better death than most, after all.~
@963  = ~How often did I have to? I will, of course. Lack of sleep will not do you any good, however.~
@964  = ~Come here, then. Ah... you are so beautiful my heart is about to stop once again... but to die like this would be a blessing, and we are cursed. But perhaps we will get through. We have each other, after all.~
@965  = ~Because of your sire, not because of you. Or because they were reckless enough to meddle with Children of Bhaal, knowing the consequences full well.~
@966  = ~Reckless enough... like you were?~
@967  = ~So do you think I am blameless?~
@968  = ~Innocents died, too. Their blood is on my conscience.~
@969  = ~Like I was and am and will be. You know the danger your companions face. But it is nothing in comparison to the danger you are in. The woman whom I, in my imperfection, dare love.~
@970  = ~My daring Xan...~
@971  = ~Really, must you be so dramatic?~
@972  = ~What is your point?~
@973  = ~My teasing <CHARNAME>...~
@974  = ~(sigh) I cannot help it, it seems.~
@975  = ~Nobody is. Your conscience should not be as heavy as you imagine it to be, however.~
@976  = ~Yours and mine - ours. Your conscience should not be as heavy as you imagine it to be, however.~
@977  = ~Take Saradush. Yes, Yaga-Shura was looking for you there. But ask yourself: should you have hidden somewhere else, would he have passed by? The city was full of your siblings. It was bound to fall sooner or later.~
@978  = ~You have done things some may call evil, true. But some would call slaying Bodhi evil, or freeing Suldanessellar. There is no point in trying to be perfect for everyone... though, mind you, I am not trying to excuse those *other* things...~
@979  = ~What *other* things? My reputation is perfect!~
@980  = ~Yes, I have done much I regret.~
@981  = ~Xan, open your eyes! I am worse than Irenicus and Bodhi put together!~
@982  = ~*Was* perfect - until the fall of Saradush, as the Tethyrian general kindly explained. But it was not my point.~
@983  = ~And so have I.~
@984  = ~Often I disagree with your choices. But we go forward. As we should, since, if we do not have each other, we have nothing. Or so I think sometimes...~
@985  = ~But enough of this. Know that I will support you whichever path you choose bar the most depraved one. And with this in mind, we will continue.~
@986  = ~I am not. Terrified, more like. But tell me: what is your fear?~
@987  = ~Losing my life.~
@988  = ~Uncertainty.~
@989  = ~Losing you and others.~
@990  = ~The end. I want our adventures to continue.~
@991  = ~I do not know. Just... fear.~
@992  = ~Ahhh... the greatest fear of all. Come, I will tell you a story.~
@993  = ~Soon, it will all be resolved. But if resolution is what you are afraid of the most...~
@994  = ~Then careful planning is your best strategy to avoid any deaths. But you told me this to be heard, not to be advised, I presume. Listen...~
@995  = ~When this ends, you will have your life, and I will have mine. Centuries to celebrate together, things you would not have imagined possible in your wildest dreams, including adventuring without end. Does it not sound appealing to you?~
@996  = ~That something may sound appealing to *you* is... strange, Xan.~
@997  = ~Yes, it does.~
@998  = ~No. I prefer to be limited in my choices, and to know what to expect.~
@999  = ~But what if I die? Or you will?~
@1000 = ~But what if we no longer are together?~
@1001 = ~Once, over a century ago, one of my missions went wrong. Not an unlikely occurrence, is it?~
@1002 = ~So, I was captured. There was no torture, no humiliation: a clean, if cold, cell, bearable rations... and a very strong door.~
@1003 = ~I was young, and within days, my hopes flared up. Perhaps I was going to be released, perhaps my mission was not improbable, perhaps I was to see my home again.~
@1004 = ~I was not, and within months, my hopes dwindled. Then, one day, a different guard entered my humble abode.~
@1005 = ~Without any preamble, he bluntly told me I was to be executed for spying. To say I was shocked is to say nothing: the place in question was not hostile to Evereska, and my mission was mere negotiation.~
@1006 = ~I was to be hanged. The next morning, the guards tied my hands, dragged me to the courtyard and forced me on my knees; a tall robed man read the sentence.~
@1007 = ~I was doomed.~
@1008 = ~I gave a last look to the sky, grey and yellow. I could not see the sun from behind the clouds, but I could see an oak tree nearby, its leaves still wet with rain, and could feel the wind on my face. The sight is in my memory still; I rarely recall this day, but I know it will never fade.~
@1009 = ~When the noose was on my neck, the executioner started to read another document. It stated that the penalty had already been carried out. "Mock execution" it was called, reserved for those whose crimes were not worth a sentence, but worth a scar on their souls, it seemed.~
@1010 = ~They let me go. I did not have a single coin on me, but it did not bother me in the slightest. Instead, I kept pressing my palms to my chest, trying to make my heart beat slower. In the end... I do not remember. I collapsed somewhere, probably. Not from shock. From happiness.~
@1011 = ~When I think of death, I often recall that day, and many near misses I had afterwards. It is a miracle I am still alive, doubly so that you are. We could have died long ago, melamin. I know we are doomed, yet I know how to chase the fear away. Now you do, too.~
@1012 = ~Ah. Quite a story.~
@1013 = ~Phew! I thought you'd never finish!~
@1014 = ~I think I understand.~
@1015 = ~But I am still afraid...~
@1016 = ~Ah, <CHARNAME>... I can barely believe it myself.~
@1017 = ~It does to me also. It sounds so awkward, does it not? Happiness. Choice. Future.~
@1018 = ~So I felt, once. Give me a certain doom and a guaranteed miserable existence; do not burden me with uncertainty, with possibilities, with heartache, with complications.~
@1019 = ~And then I met you.~
@1020 = ~Then it will be your and only your choice, and I will not be able to question it. If you make it... then so be it.~
@1021 = ~I have a strange hope to the contrary, however. Emotions are strange things, sometimes. But come. Our future awaits.~
@1022 = ~Amin mela <CHARNAME>, - now, this is easier. Come, our future awaits.~
@1023 = ~It is. It was hard to tell, as well.~
@1024 = ~Well, I did, and now it is indeed the time to move on. Come, our future awaits.~
@1025 = ~I thought you would. Otherwise... I am not sure I would have dared share it. It was... hard.~
@1026 = ~I am here for you. I know it is hard at times... hard indeed.~
@1027 = ~This he does. Are you satisfied?~
@1028 = ~I am. He paid for what he did to me, Khalid, Dynaheir and Imoen.~
@1029 = ~My only regret is that it was not done earlier.~
@1030 = ~I saw him in a vision, surrounded by the Slayers, thrown into a lake of lava.~
@1031 = ~Only partly. Something is unfinished.~
@1032 = ~I pity him.~
@1033 = ~Yes. Are you?~
@1034 = ~(shudder) A grievous fate indeed. Did he deserve it, in your opinion?~
@1035 = ~Thrice over. I would help if I were there.~
@1036 = ~He did. His victims suffered worse.~
@1037 = ~Yes, his crimes were grave enough for this.~
@1038 = ~Nobody deserves torture. Not me, not you, and not Irenicus.~
@1039 = ~Perhaps, but not for an eternity. This is too harsh.~
@1040 = ~It sounds right and proper, what you say. Still...~
@1041 = ~I pity him, as well, though I cannot find any compassion for his plight. He killed, maimed and tortured freely, so in his case, justice had obviously been done. Still...~
@1042 = ~Something is unfinished... unsaid. I think I understand your meaning.~
@1043 = ~I cannot help but wonder if there was a way to turn him on the right path, back to Elvendom. We are few, <CHARNAME>, painstakingly few, and it is a hard blow to every elf when one of our own behaves like this.~
@1044 = ~If we managed to return him into the fold, it would have been a victory. Now, in a way, I feel defeated.~
@1045 = ~Do you mean that you were ready to forgive this sadist?~
@1046 = ~I do not think Demin or Elhan were eager to show mercy.~
@1047 = ~It was impossible. You heard him yourself.~
@1048 = ~I wonder, as well.~
@1049 = ~Irenicus emerging triumphant with my soul does not sound like a victory to me.~
@1050 = ~I was not. If he had shown true repentance, however, everything might have been different.~
@1051 = ~They were not. If he had shown true repentance, however, everything might have been different.~
@1052 = ~I did. (sigh) If he had shown true repentance, however, everything might have been different.~
@1053 = ~It is a scary thought, is it not? We are victorious, but as we walk, Irenicus burns in the Nether Realms - literally.~
@1054 = ~I do not think I will sleep well tonight.~
@1055 = ~I did not mean *that*, Seldarine help us! No, no... that would have been terrible beyond belief. But if he came, and surrendered of his own volition, and prepared to atone for his crimes, perhaps Rillifane would have granted him forgiveness. As would we.~
@1056 = ~Magic is my life. I enjoy it, as well as I can.~
@1057 = ~I am happy for you, my friend.~
@1058 = ~Has anything else changed?~
@1059 = ~Do you feel you are a different person now?~
@1060 = ~It is true that life seems duller now. I can almost vouch for my survival, whereas mere months ago any blow could kill me. Still, I am the same person I once was. Or do you have doubts?~
@1061 = ~No, I don't. I was merely curious.~
@1062 = ~You have changed, but I cannot quite put a finger on how.~
@1063 = ~Yes, I have doubts. You are not the same old Xan anymore.~
@1064 = ~I feel better, as well. Not for long, I am sure, but I welcome the feeling regardless.~
@1065 = ~I thought I was, until now.~
@1066 = ~You are right, though: there is a change. Perhaps a subtle one, but a change nevertheless. New stride; new confidence. I owe it to you, my friend, and your company. Strange, isn't it? I expected to find my doom in your face, and found my vocation, instead.~
@1067 = ~See? Told you so!~
@1068 = ~Fate has strange ways.~
@1069 = ~I am glad you did.~
@1070 = ~Never fear, you may yet find both.~
@1071 = ~(sigh) You did indeed.~
@1072 = ~But nothing have changed in the big picture of things: my doom is just over the corner, I am sure. Shall we proceed to meet it?~
@1073 = ~Alas, we indeed may.~
@1074 = ~Ah... an enemy of yours?~
@1075 = ~No, rather... a close friend.~
@1076 = ~No, a companion. Does it matter?~
@1077 = ~I was talking about yourself, actually.~
@1078 = ~A local authority.~
@1079 = ~Yes, I it is about our strategy for the next battle.~
@1080 = ~Certainly. Remind me again to memorize some extra enchantments before we rest, won't you?~
@1081 = ~<CHARNAME>! Are you... what do you think you are going to do?~
@1082 = ~Aw, Xan! Don't you ever use your spells for your personal benefit?~
@1083 = ~I am sure you seduced a wench or two with your magic. Time to share!~
@1084 = ~What if I plan to use the spells on you, eh?~
@1085 = ~Oh, never mind. It was only a harmless joke.~
@1086 = ~On *me*? Seldarine, why? What have I done to you?~
@1087 = ~Well... I do not know how else to catch your attention.~
@1088 = ~Because I want you, silly!~
@1089 = ~I thought it was a good joke: an enchanter being enchanted!~
@1090 = ~You are way too arrogant now, always telling me what to do!~
@1091 = ~I wanted you to stop questioning my orders.~
@1092 = ~I hope you are not planning anything... unlawful. It is risky at best, and suicidal at worst. Besides, the spell's duration is limited.~
@1093 = ~But very well; I shall do as you suggest. Remind me again to memorize some extra enchantments before we rest, won't you?~
@1094 = ~I never... how dare you...~
@1095 = ~(sigh) <CHARNAME>, you are young and reckless, and too carefree for your own good. Do not repeat your request again.~
@1096 = ~(sigh) Not so harmless. But it is a relief that you were not planning... what I thought you were planning.~
@1097 = ~(sigh) <CHARNAME>, <CHARNAME>...~
@1098 = ~Let us forget this conversation, shall we?~
@1099 = ~All right.~
@1100 = ~But... oh, never mind.~
@1101 = ~Xan, please...~
@1102 = ~I shall stop questioning you immediately. Or, if you wish, I shall stop talking to you at all. You need but say a word.~
@1103 = ~Do not resort to extreme measures, unless you wish to find your party one member short.~
@1104 = ~Yes. I think it is best if we stop right here.~
@1105 = ~(sigh) What?~
@1106 = ~Nothing.~
@1107 = ~I know you quietly loved me all this time. Didn't you?~
@1108 = ~We still can have something, Xan.~
@1109 = ~Yes, we are... good friends.~
@1110 = ~A few years later, perhaps, you will seek me out in Evereska, or I will meet you somewhere along the Sword Coast, and we will laugh about this conversation.~
@1111 = ~Or we will not.~
@1112 = ~Or...~
@1113 = ~But that is enough for one day.~
@1114 = ~(sigh) I do. But what is the point of musing about it now?~
@1115 = ~None. I simply wanted to offer support.~
@1116 = ~Perhaps it will make it easier for you?~
@1117 = ~I would talk of Candlekeep to anyone who would listen.~
@1118 = ~Make no mistake, I am grateful. But... perhaps you will tell me of Candlekeep, instead?~
@1119 = ~I suppose I could.~
@1120 = ~No, I am in no mood for this.~
@1121 = ~Would you want to listen?~
@1122 = ~No, no. I feel vulnerable when I talk of it, and my mortality weighs on me too heavily for my liking.~
@1123 = ~Then, I suppose, there is nothing but our current surroundings. And I have no desire to speak of those.~
@1124 = ~I would.~
@1125 = ~Do go on.~
@1126 = ~I miss the feeling of having a home. Candlekeep welcomed me as no other place did.~
@1127 = ~I had friends there, real ones. And a semblance of a family, as well.~
@1128 = ~It was secure. I could walk around unarmed and not fear for my safety.~
@1129 = ~I never knew how much evil was outside then. I wish I still didn't.~
@1130 = ~I do not miss the place.~
@1131 = ~As did Evereska. We are both homeless, aren't we?~
@1132 = ~You still have friends. I am a poor replacement, of course, but there are others.~
@1133 = ~And it seems you are close to starting a family already.~
@1134 = ~Yes... yes. I close my eyes and see myself walking around the Everaskan Vale in simple clothes, picking berries, lying under trees and reading books...~
@1135 = ~(sigh) This disease plagues us all - the disease of knowledge. We want more and more, and then suddenly realize we'd have been better left off not knowing.~
@1136 = ~Candlekeep was colder to you than Evereska was to me, I know this much.~
@1137 = ~And so we are both on the road, naught but a temporary roof over our heads - or, in your case, a small plane of your own. Still, it is temporary. What awaits us in the future?~
@1138 = ~A larger plane for me, that's for certain.~
@1139 = ~We can return, should we want to.~
@1140 = ~A new home to look forward to.~
@1141 = ~Ah, your ambition shines through yet again. It's tough to be a god, <CHARNAME>, have you forgotten?~
@1142 = ~We can... and perhaps we will.~
@1143 = ~But will we still have a place to return to?~
@1144 = ~Neither do I. Evereska calls, however, and I will answer.~
@1145 = ~But will I still have a place to return to?~
@1146 = ~(sigh) Death, more likely.~
@1147 = ~Your hopeless optimism again. Well... perhaps. For you, at least.~
@1148 = ~What else do you want to know?~
@1149 = ~Your childhood. What was it like?~
@1150 = ~Where did you study magic?~
@1151 = ~How did you become a Greycloak?~
@1152 = ~Your first mission. What was it?~
@1153 = ~How prominent is your family?~
@1154 = ~Nothing else, thank you.~
@1155 = ~Sheltered, private, and blissful. I do not remember anyone shouting at me, or giving me orders, or indeed advancing at me with a club, like so many seem to, these days.~
@1156 = ~I spent enough time with my parents, and more than enough time on my own. I had learnt to read before I had learnt to walk, so books were my best companions then. Historic scrolls, mainly; magic scrolls came later.~
@1157 = ~Since Evereska was so well protected over two centuries ago, I could walk everywhere on my own, and I did. On my own, I discovered the many miracles of the city, and when the time came, my parents guided my steps to its libraries and finally, to the Academy of Magic.~
@1158 = ~But that's another story entirely.~
@1159 = ~At the Academy of Magic, of course - the only worthy place to study in Evereska. Candlekeep reminds me of it: vast halls, containing improbable amounts of knowledge and nigh impossible to get into, unless summoned or invited. Invited I was.~
@1160 = ~I never noticed whether I was one of the best or the worst students, so much I was absorbed in my spells. I should have paid more attention to my peers, I see it now. But what was done was done: when the time came to leave the Academy walls, I was as alone as I was at the time I had entered it.~
@1161 = ~Enchantments ran strong in my family, so I had chosen this direction. New spells were coming easier than I thought, and by the time my education was complete, I was powerful enough to be chosen as a Greycloak. Though by then, of course, I was wielding a moonblade, as well...~
@1162 = ~But I do not wish to recall those days.~
@1163 = ~The father of my father was one. So was my father. I took up the blade; I felt obliged to take up their allegiance, as well.~
@1164 = ~Besides, I was taught to follow my duty in my early childhood. I could not imagine any other fate.~
@1165 = ~It was away from Evereska; a sudden change of scenery. I was not performing alone: two elder Greycloaks accompanied me. I was a leader, formally, but it meant nothing, as you imagine.~
@1166 = ~We destroyed over a dozen orcs in the High Forest. It was bloody, though all I had to do was cast two spells in the beginning: my colleagues sealed their fate.~
@1167 = ~It was also the time when I started thinking of life as hollow, and could never stop afterwards. (sigh) A boring story, was it not?~
@1168 = ~Very. I would not compare directly, but while the royalty stands apart, my House is older than most. The moonblade I wear is living proof.~
@1169 = ~It is difficult to be among the nobility in Evereska, however. Too much is expected of one. Duties, training, social life... Fortunately, I had escaped the latter, but many had not.~
@1170 = ~And, of course, since my parents are both dead and I am formally the head of my House, there is also the responsibility of upholding the family honor. I still wonder if I am doing it justice, traveling with you.~
@1171 = ~Perhaps not, but on the other hand, how much blood would have been shed otherwise?~
@1172 = ~I hope you are satisfied, then.~
@1173 = ~True enough. (sigh) Traveling with a Child of Bhaal - what more certain a doom could there be?~
@1174 = ~Traveling with a Child of Bhaal and repeating it time after time?~
@1175 = ~Oh, I could name several, and my enemies would confirm my words.~
@1176 = ~None. You are doomed, Xan. DOOMED.~
@1177 = ~I do not think it is all because of me. There are other factors.~
@1178 = ~(sigh) Ah, yes. This is yet another one.~
@1179 = ~Perhaps. But the very fact that you have enemies in numbers confirms *my* words.~
@1180 = ~(sigh) And yet I am still here.~
@1181 = ~There are indeed. Somehow, however, they all seem to be loosely connected to your heritage. Coincidence? I do not think so.~
@1182 = ~Now that you know we *are* doomed, you will find everything so much simpler. Nothing matters as much, not anymore. Being alive is already a gift, all the more precious because you know how quickly it can be taken away.~
@1183 = ~But I have always known it.~
@1184 = ~There are things that matter. Love, for instance.~
@1185 = ~I will not stop caring for others, regardless.~
@1186 = ~Power always matters, and I am going to multiply mine.~
@1187 = ~Then you are wiser than I thought you to be.~
@1188 = ~Love... (sigh) I...~
@1189 = ~No, never mind.~
@1190 = ~Commendable. And futile. But who am I to complain?~
@1191 = ~Until what? Power draws powerful enemies, <CHARNAME>. You, like no one else, should know this much.~
@1192 = ~Regardless, we are doomed, and it is hopeless to continue this conversation. (sigh) Shall we?~
@1193 = ~Do you truly wish to know?~
@1194 = ~Why not?~
@1195 = ~Not really. Forget I asked.~
@1196 = ~(sigh) Gladly. If only I could...~
@1197 = ~I am still alive. So I suppose our actions have not yet crossed the line. Or they have, but, however cynical it sounds, you are doomed to stop this slaughter, and thus, Corellon does not interfere. Or he is forbidden to interfere. Or...~
@1198 = ~It is complicated, <CHARNAME>. But we live, and that's what is important. Don't you agree?~
@1199 = ~I do, it is just I am curious, as well.~
@1200 = ~It does not sound very encouraging.~
@1201 = ~So, is there a chance you will drop dead one day?~
@1202 = ~But what do you think?~
@1203 = ~True. To think that my blade may simply extinguish my life one day - it is not a comforting thought. But what choice do I have?~
@1204 = ~I see little sense in your inquiry, to be honest. Look inside yourself, and your conscience will give you the answer. I cannot converse with my moonblade: it is not sentient, or, at least, not the way you imagine.~
@1205 = ~I have hope, however. I read Alaundo's prophecies, and I believe you indeed are the one who is meant to stop this bloody massacre. This alone stops me from leaving. And there is another reason...~
@1206 = ~What is it?~
@1207 = ~I am glad you stayed.~
@1208 = ~You have hope? Xan, are you all right?~
@1209 = ~Well, this was optimistic.~
@1210 = ~You are my friend. I would have it no other way.~
@1211 = ~(sigh) I shouldn't have said that. It will be just my bad luck if you decide to join the Five out of sheer contrariness.~
@1212 = ~(groan) Just as I thought that things could not become any worse. What next, <CHARNAME>?~
@1213 = ~Well, being a <LADYLORD> of Murder opens many interesting possibilities...~
@1214 = ~What do you mean, 'what next'?~
@1215 = ~Next I will challenge Corellon and Ao, and gain control over their domains.~
@1216 = ~A duel with Cyric, I suppose. Why?~
@1217 = ~Lovely. I trust world domination is your next goal?~
@1218 = ~I wonder why you are telling me all this. Every time we are about to plunge into yet another hopeless battle, or accept another risky venture, you look at me as if asking my opinion. You know I do not approve; yet, you never follow my advice.~
@1219 = ~So I wonder, why? Why ask me?~
@1220 = ~I simply need someone to talk to.~
@1221 = ~I like watching your reaction.~
@1222 = ~No specific reason. Just asking.~
@1223 = ~Who knows, perhaps I will follow your advice one day.~
@1224 = ~I am here to listen. But not to agree, I fear.~
@1225 = ~(sigh) I suspected as much.~
@1226 = ~(sigh) Such a chaotic personality you have...~
@1227 = ~I will be long dead then, I fear.~
@1228 = ~You are a rare one, <CHARNAME>. You have power over your friends and enemies, and, willingly or not, you are doing a lot of good in this world. Suldanessellar praises you, still, and so do Baldur's Gate and Athkatla.~
@1229 = ~Many despise you, but many admire. You have a destiny here, trust me on this. You are young, and life has not yet become hollow for you. Perhaps it never will. Think on it, before making your choices. Bhaal's shadow has been stretching over you for long enough.~
@1230 = ~My choices are already made.~
@1231 = ~I will think about it.~
@1232 = ~Bhaal's shadow will disappear. This is my legacy, and mine alone.~
@1233 = ~Perhaps you are right. Godhood is not worth my freedom.~
@1234 = ~It is your life to live.~
@1235 = ~Seldarine, let <HIMHER> make a right choice...~
@1236 = ~A tragedy.~
@1237 = ~And that's it?~
@1238 = ~Do you think we are responsible?~
@1239 = ~Could its destruction be avoided somehow?~
@1240 = ~What else can I say? Besides, words do not seem to be of any use here.~
@1241 = ~Partly. But we could not take out Yaga-Shura any earlier, could we? I do not think we had a chance.~
@1242 = ~Yes, it could. Back at the time your siblings started to assemble there.~
@1243 = ~Someone very intelligent and charismatic had to be there when it started, to convince the Bhaalspawn they would actually be *safer* there. It was a blatant lie: a group of your siblings was more likely to attract the Five than one or two; a city full of Bhaalspawn would attract them faster, still. It was pure folly.~
@1244 = ~Melissan gathered them there.~
@1245 = ~I do not think that it was possible to foresee the consequences.~
@1246 = ~Bhaalspawn were killed one by one in the wilderness, as well. You cannot blame them for seeking shelter.~
@1247 = ~My arrival was the last straw, however. Yaga-Shura was determined to get me.~
@1248 = ~If not for the likes of Gromnir, Saradush would still be standing.~
@1249 = ~She did. What did she hope to gain? She is either very vicious or very stupid, and I see her as neither. I wonder...~
@1250 = ~It was. You could foresee the consequences, when you sailed to Spellhold. You full well knew the consequences, when you started chasing your foster father's murderer.~
@1251 = ~Yet you went on, since you had no choice. Perhaps in the end, neither had they.~
@1252 = ~Yes... yes, you are correct, and I was blind in my arrogance. (sigh) Still, I cannot help but wonder if they knew...~
@1253 = ~If you never came, they could have an extra day, a tenday, or even a month. Perhaps your arrival robbed them of their last days. But could you actually save them?~
@1254 = ~They were Bhaalspawn, and as such, they were doomed. As are you.~
@1255 = ~Perhaps, perhaps not. We will never know. Regardless, we destroyed him, and many thanked you for it.~
@1256 = ~I suppose we did all we could. Do not look down, <CHARNAME>. The city was doomed from the start. Due to your intervention, many lived who could have died, in Saradush and outside of it.~
@1257 = ~I suppose. Still, it feels like it was my fault.~
@1258 = ~And many died who could have lived.~
@1259 = ~Don't you care about these deaths?~
@1260 = ~Thank you. I guess you are right.~
@1261 = ~Mine, yours, Melissan's... Too many were involved to say for sure.~
@1262 = ~Dwell on your future, my friend. It matters more than failures past.~
@1263 = ~And yet we are still alive...~
@1264 = ~I do. I expected them to die, so I grieved in advance. It is more... practical. But yes, I do care.~
@1265 = ~(sigh) I wish I was not...~
@1266 = ~Death?~
@1267 = ~Power! Power beyond belief, my friend!~
@1268 = ~Death? Ha! Deaths of my enemies, yes.~
@1269 = ~No! Can you think of nothing else?~
@1270 = ~Not death. Something else... a transformation, perhaps.~
@1271 = ~I have no idea.~
@1272 = ~Delusions all. You are delirious again, <CHARNAME>.~
@1273 = ~No. Especially since it's the truth.~
@1274 = ~A transformation? Meaning you will become an undead or worse?~
@1275 = ~Then death it is.~
@1276 = ~But I apologize. You are right: something grand is in store for you, and I think we are all aware of it. As we go on, it becomes more and more obvious that Alaundo's prophecies spoke of you, and you alone. The part when he says about "claiming their father's legacy", however, does not inspire me at all.~
@1277 = ~I do not see anything wrong with it.~
@1278 = ~Would you prefer if it ended with "this inheritor will die immediately after"?~
@1279 = ~It does not inspire me, either. But I hope to be given a choice.~
@1280 = ~Bhaal's legacy can be used for noble ends, as well.~
@1281 = ~No, no. Anything is better than this, though some may disagree. I wish to see you alive, however.~
@1282 = ~All hope is futile. But who knows?~
@1283 = ~(snort) And Lolth can help people, if she so desires. But does she?~
@1284 = ~But... enough. I will not be able to add anything more, besides that I am on your side, and will continue to be.~
@1285 = ~Let us hope for the best... and prepare for the worst.~
@1286 = ~Does my opinion matter?~
@1287 = ~I will send him away, if you advise me to do so.~
@1288 = ~It might.~
@1289 = ~I would like to know your thoughts, in any case.~
@1290 = ~(sigh) I am flattered, I am sure. But very well.~
@1291 = ~Somehow, I doubt it. But very well.~
@1292 = ~I think of Tamoko when I think of him. She believed it was Bhaal's blood that corrupted Sarevok and made him do unspeakable things, not the man himself.~
@1293 = ~But the last time we met her, in the Undercity... she changed her mind. She understood it was not blood alone that made him do these things. That it was possible to be different.~
@1294 = ~Time will show whether he will learn to be different, but for the time being I find it hard to believe. He will not attack you, of that I am sure. He finds you useful - for now. But will he atone for his crimes? For Gorion, for the slaves of the Iron Throne in Cloakwood, for those who died in Candlekeep? I do not know.~
@1295 = ~I do not want him to repent. I want him to serve.~
@1296 = ~Atonement takes time, Xan.~
@1297 = ~I hope to help him realize it.~
@1298 = ~Why should he repent, in any case?~
@1299 = ~Then serve he will, but little else.~
@1300 = ~And effort. Do you think he shows any?~
@1301 = ~Best of luck to you. I am skeptical, however.~
@1302 = ~Because if he does not, he will face the worst punishment imaginable: not being half the man he could be.~
@1303 = ~(sigh) Forgive me. I look back at what I just said, and my words are full of arrogance once again. I blame Sarevok, but it seems I myself will never learn...~
@1304 = ~I... I would like to be alone for a while.~
@1305 = ~He is a man I have learnt to respect. Yes, he has changed, I think. Hopefully for good - in both senses.~
@1306 = ~Heh. Yes, I like "good" Sarevok better, too.~
@1307 = ~I hope so.~
@1308 = ~I miss his "unholy rage", though.~
@1309 = ~Do you trust him now, then?~
@1310 = ~Oh, you can still see plenty on the battlefield. (sigh) Just pay attention to his shouts.~
@1311 = ~I trusted him not to betray us from the start. Now, I think I trust him fully.~
@1312 = ~Have you forgiven him for Gorion's murder?~
@1313 = ~Yes, I have. He was not himself then.~
@1314 = ~Yes, I accepted his repentance.~
@1315 = ~Bhaal in him killed Gorion, not Sarevok.~
@1316 = ~I will never be able to forget that. But I am willing to put it aside.~
@1317 = ~Did Bhaal kill Irenicus, or did you? Did Bhaal kill Gorion, or was it... Sarevok?~
@1318 = ~I never found my father's murderer, but if I ever do, I do not think forgiveness will even remotely be on my mind. (sigh) You are a much better person than I am.~
@1319 = ~Now that you know my feelings... will we be together?~
@1320 = ~What does the future hold for us, Xan? For us two?~
@1321 = ~Oh. I thought you have made your choices already... ?~
@1322 = ~Yes, in that I want to be with you.~
@1323 = ~Everything can be changed, Xan.~
@1324 = ~What do you mean? There is no one else in my life.~
@1325 = ~Back then I did not know we had a chance.~
@1326 = ~(sigh) <CHARNAME>...~
@1327 = ~You can change your path however you wish, true. But will it make you any happier?~
@1328 = ~Except for yourself, and the decisions you made long ago.~
@1329 = ~(sigh) Perhaps it would have been better for all involved if you never found out.~
@1330 = ~I cannot turn myself inside out in split seconds. Neither, I suspect, can you. If what you want is to come to be, there is time. And time is what it will take.~
@1331 = ~"What I want?" What about you?~
@1332 = ~I suppose. But do we have the luxury of time?~
@1333 = ~We've traveled together for so long... What more can you need?~
@1334 = ~I will not wait. It is now or never.~
@1335 = ~I do care about you. But nothing good will come out of rushing things.~
@1336 = ~No, we do not. But nothing good will come out of rushing things.~
@1337 = ~We have had enough time to grow close, yes, but in a different way. Nothing good will come out of rushing things.~
@1338 = ~No, <CHARNAME>. It is hopeless. Excuse me.~
@1339 = ~Your path as a Bhaalspawn is about to reach its finale. I do not even want to think about what awaits you in the end, and neither do I want to add more to your load. I will be there for you, this I promise.~
@1340 = ~As a friend?~
@1341 = ~And after it ends?~
@1342 = ~Thank you, Xan.~
@1343 = ~You could... be with me in a more intimate way, as well.~
@1344 = ~Yes. I do not think any other... alternatives are wise.~
@1345 = ~But - ~
@1346 = ~We will talk of this another time.~
@1347 = ~It is the least I can do. After all, you have been there for me, say, how many times?~
@1348 = ~(sigh) But there is more to this, of course.~
@1349 = ~No, I could not. (sigh) Not only it is unwise, but we may easily lose what we already have - friendship.~
@1350 = ~(sigh) You excel in asking difficult questions, do you know that?~
@1351 = ~(grin) Why, I do.~
@1352 = ~So, what is the answer?~
@1353 = ~Oh, really?~
@1354 = ~And you are beautiful when you smile.~
@1355 = ~I will get to this in a moment.~
@1356 = ~Really. Or did you have any doubt?~
@1357 = ~It is difficult indeed, since what I am about to say might sound unflattering to you. I...~
@1358 = ~<CHARNAME>, all these months I kept saying that Evereska was in danger. I could not do anything significant for my city then - a mission or two was my utmost possible. However, now it is different.~
@1359 = ~I must return to my city. To my disbelief - and yours, I am sure - I am an Archmage. It means I can do at least something for my people. And it also means I will not be able to stay with you.~
@1360 = ~I... I understand.~
@1361 = ~What if I go with you?~
@1362 = ~And once Evereska is safe?~
@1363 = ~But you will be able to travel with me later, won't you?~
@1364 = ~(sigh) I am glad you do.~
@1365 = ~You can, of course. But I would advise you against it. I do not want to put you into yet *more danger*.~
@1366 = ~But... if you truly wanted to... to leave all behind and follow me... (sigh) <CHARNAME>, do I even deserve such a gift?~
@1367 = ~I will have to remain there.~
@1368 = ~I... do not think so, no.~
@1369 = ~Too much depends on my pathetic efforts. I never expected this. To tell you the truth, I was not sure if I should return, but duty, indeed, overweighs all. I must defend Evereska to the last, and ensure the city's safety afterwards.~
@1370 = ~So, no, our biographers will not be scribing their regular "ever after", neither will we have a guaranteed happy ending. However, if, at some point in the future, you decide to throw caution to the winds, however unwise it may be, and seek me out, then...~
@1371 = ~Then?~
@1372 = ~Yes?~
@1373 = ~I know, I know!~
@1374 = ~Then yes, <CHARNAME>. There can be no doubt as to how I feel.~
@1375 = ~I feel this separation is needed - for me, and for you. Things happen too fast, and a rash decision may hurt us both. Watching you from afar all this time had been difficult enough. But if you are certain, and will continue to be certain... because I do not wish to ruin your life, your happiness... and if we are both alive then... then you need but make the journey, and I'll be waiting.~
@1376 = ~But until then... friends?~
@1377 = ~Friends.~
@1378 = ~So, in the end... things will be different?~
@1379 = ~Xan... kiss me? Once.~
@1380 = ~I am glad we have each other.~
@1381 = ~No, my dear friend. They won't be. I will return to Evereska, and you - you have a multitude of choices, and a long, brilliant life to lead. (sigh) If the first drunken brawl does not end it, that is.~
@1382 = ~But, should you wish it, we shall meet again. What will happen then depends only on you. And - I hope - it will be completely out of the scope of the Bhaalspawn saga.~
@1383 = ~Just - this - once.~
@1384 = ~Or twice.~
@1385 = ~Oh, <CHARNAME>...~
@1386 = ~You have been a good friend to me all this time. I want to thank you.~
@1387 = ~I am happy with you. Don't you ever think otherwise.~
@1388 = ~I was not going to, although... yes, I do have... doubts. From time to time.~
@1389 = ~Silly. Don't you know you are all I need?~
@1390 = ~Well, I do not.~
@1391 = ~So do I, sometimes. But we are together, and happy. This is all that matters.~
@1392 = ~I'd be horrified if this were true. You need much more than me, and whatever little I can provide. Air, water, friends, experience, even money - I do not think we would have survived if everything else disappeared. Do you?~
@1393 = ~Xan, you are such a bore sometimes. Relax!~
@1394 = ~I didn't mean it seriously - only as a compliment.~
@1395 = ~Mmm. Perhaps you are right.~
@1396 = ~I am relieved to hear this. But of course, your heart has always been wiser than mine.~
@1397 = ~Ah, indeed. So happy that it frightens me at times, to be honest. But I will get used to it - at least, I hope I will have time to.~
@1398 = ~What is the point?~
@1399 = ~I sometimes wonder if it is too much of a good fortune. We are alive, powerful enough to battle the mightiest of foes, and we are together. Will something terrible happen again? (sigh) I sometimes lie awake for hours, pondering this.~
@1400 = ~What will come will come. Worrying will not help.~
@1401 = ~We suffered enough. Everyone is entitled to some happiness.~
@1402 = ~Hey, it is pointless!~
@1403 = ~I know. I do, too.~
@1404 = ~(sigh) Indeed.~
@1405 = ~I would like to think so. But for how long will it last?~
@1406 = ~Yes, we are two of a kind, are we not?~
@1407 = ~But enough. I have you, you - me, and it is not going to change anytime soon... anytime at all, if I have a say in it.~
@1408 = ~Tee-hee! Such determination!~
@1409 = ~And if I have my say.~
@1410 = ~I love it when you look confident.~
@1411 = ~It depends on you. If you do not send me away again...~
@1412 = ~(chuckle) Such a determined pair we are...~
@1413 = ~And I love you.~
@1414 = ~Shh... We cannot change the past, but we can try to steer our future the best we can. Together.~
@1415 = ~I appreciate the sentiment. And, of course, you are very welcome.~
@1416 = ~Has it occurred to you that we can be more than just friends?~
@1417 = ~Yes. We've been through thick and thin, eh?~
@1418 = ~Still, we are going to part ways eventually.~
@1419 = ~Well... this is it.~
@1420 = ~Quite so. Ah, <CHARNAME>, can you believe we are still alive?~
@1421 = ~(sigh) I will miss your company. Still, it will be good to return home.~
@1422 = ~And it was more than enough. Thank you.~
@1423 = ~<CHARNAME>, I believe we discussed the matter already. Of course, your non-elven heritage, your shadowed past and your numerous foes make you an enticing romantic prospect; still, I must decline.~
@1424 = ~(cough) I apologize. It was a poor attempt at sarcasm, it seems - I only wanted to lighten the mood somewhat. We are good friends, and I never considered otherwise. Have I answered your question?~
@1425 = ~Hmph!~
@1426 = ~Pfft!~
@1427 = ~Well, *you* are no prize, either.~
@1428 = ~Sure. We are good and close friends, after all.~
@1429 = ~(sigh)~
@1430 = ~Ah, yes. It is good to see you being your charming self again.~
@1431 = ~Isn't it a tiny bit too late to discuss the matter, <CHARNAME>? You are, after all, firmly enveloped... ah, firmly on your way to godhood or whatever it is that lies ahead. Our time together grows short.~
@1432 = ~Besides... do you truly feel thus?~
@1433 = ~You never answered the question.~
@1434 = ~I am just curious.~
@1435 = ~Yes, I do.~
@1436 = ~Actually, I felt like this for a long, long time.~
@1437 = ~No, I do not.~
@1438 = ~But I tried to bring the matter with you before!~
@1439 = ~(sigh) Yes, I remember.~
@1440 = ~Well... the thought did cross my mind more than once, I admit. But why start something which is obviously doomed? And now it is far, far too late.~
@1441 = ~It is not. We still have a chance.~
@1442 = ~But I like you a lot.~
@1443 = ~You are right, I suppose.~
@1444 = ~I agree. Besides, I never felt the spark, anyway.~
@1445 = ~Oh. I never...~
@1446 = ~<CHARNAME>, to say you are full of surprises is to say nothing - you can turn someone's life upside down and never notice. (sigh) This is doomed, don't you understand that? Besides, there is - ~
@1447 = ~No, no, enough of this. I must think...~
@1448 = ~Yes, then... shall we go?~
@1449 = ~What more can I say? It has been a pleasure traveling with you. Perhaps we shall meet again, if the circumstances allow it - and if we are still alive.~
@1450 = ~Well, there is a small matter of the Throne of Bhaal...~
@1451 = ~I would like that.~
@1452 = ~I do not think it will be possible.~
@1453 = ~True. Then, alas, our meeting will not come to be, since we will doubtlessly die. Or you will become a god, which is essentially the same to us mortals.~
@1454 = ~So would I.~
@1455 = ~Well, you never know, do you? Who would have thought you'd survive this far, for one?~
@1456 = ~But you have had enough of my musings, I am sure. Shall we go?~
@1457 = ~Hey. Hey there. Are you all right?~ [O#XAN277]
@1458 = ~Definitely not. Not until I kill the bastard who's done it.~
@1459 = ~My head hurts, but other than that, I am fine.~
@1460 = ~Where am I? And what happened?~
@1461 = ~Very much so. It is relieving to be with my party again.~
@1462 = ~I would like that, as well, but fortunately or unfortunately, they are all gone now.~
@1463 = ~Good.~
@1464 = ~You are with us, among friends, and everything is fine... well, as fine as it can be, considering the circumstances. That is, as hopeless as ever.~
@1465 = ~We are relieved to see you, as well, I am sure. I was worried we'll never see you again.~
@1466 = ~Actually, I was scared senseless. Only now I understand how much you meant for us. For the group, as a leader, I mean. Not just a friend, a comrade, a close companion, but a driving force, presence, will.~
@1467 = ~We freed the women after you were gone. They were thankful, and Siene went as far as offering me her Boots of Speed. I hope you will find them useful.~
@1468 = ~They were highly impressed by your sacrifice. I suppose I am, as well. You are a true hero, <CHARNAME>.~
@1469 = ~Why, thank you. I am flattered.~
@1470 = ~Xan, stop fawning! Now, where are these boots?~
@1471 = ~All right, all right, stop making me blush!~
@1472 = ~So, this is over?~
@1473 = ~There is nothing to thank me for: this is the truth.~
@1474 = ~(sigh) I knew you'd ask about our reward first and foremost. <CHARNAME>, <CHARNAME>... will you never learn?~
@1475 = ~I am sorry if I did. I spoke the truth, however.~
@1476 = ~As over as it can be.~
@1477 = ~Your things are still outside. We would do well to go and pick them up. Come?~
@1478 = ~I have been thinking about these women...~ [O#XAN278]
@1479 = ~Yes?~
@1480 = ~Don't tell me you fell in love with one of them.~
@1481 = ~I still wish they were alive.~
@1482 = ~I've been thinking of them, too.~
@1483 = ~Nonsense. <CHARNAME>, I hate to ask you this, but do you ever think of - anything else?~
@1484 = ~But let's not go *there* again.~
@1485 = ~Where shall I start?~
@1486 = ~What happened to these elven girls was a huge injustice. And even now, as I know they are safely walking home - now that I think of it, perhaps not so safely - their captors are probably preparing for their next journey, likely hoping to slip through Amkethran unnoticed. And soon, new victims will fall to their schemes.~
@1487 = ~I do what I can, Xan. But sometimes it is not enough.~
@1488 = ~What do you propose?~
@1489 = ~I do not care, to be honest. The Five concern me much more.~
@1490 = ~We can lay an ambush in Amkethran. Actually, it is a damn good idea.~
@1491 = ~I know, and I can say the same about myself. There is something we can do, however.~
@1492 = ~The slavers, as I said, will go back through Amkethran. And I have a feeling that we will meet again - that we must meet again. More, my moonblade becomes warm every time I ponder this, which means we have at least a slim chance.~
@1493 = ~Let us return to the place where we found the women. I know with strange certainty that our efforts will be rewarded. Too little time has passed, true, but my moonblade has never steered me wrong before.~
@1494 = ~I more than agree. What I propose will not take much time, however.~
@1495 = ~Exactly what I have in mind, <CHARNAME>. An excellent idea.~
@1496 = ~I felt despair grow in me through these past days. It's been no big pleasure, either. How come that young, innocent women - girls - fall to the carrion crawlers of the human world as easily as they do?~
@1497 = ~The sword in my hand is a symbol of justice, a weighty one. Yet, it is no more than a symbol. It could not save them all, it could not shelter them, it could not... Ah, <CHARNAME>.~
@1498 = ~I know. It saddens me, too.~
@1499 = ~But you've known it will be like this, haven't you?~
@1500 = ~You failed your missions before, didn't you?~
@1501 = ~Cut the drama, and let us go.~
@1502 = ~At least we killed the bastards.~
@1503 = ~Alas, it will keep happening. But knowing that I am not alone in this makes it easier, somehow. Thank you.~
@1504 = ~I have, and I thought I was prepared for this. I've been on the road longer than you've been alive, you know. Still, every time the sorrow is new, and as sharp as ever.~
@1505 = ~(sigh) Thank you for reminding me. Yes, I failed... one might even call me a failure, were these tasks not doomed anyway. But even as I see nothing could be done, I keep replaying it in my head, searching... thinking...~
@1506 = ~(sigh) Lead on. I shall follow.~
@1507 = ~We did, but what is the point? New ones will come.~
@1508 = ~(sigh) It is hopeless. The only thing that keeps me from lying down and dying is that it could be much worse. But I thank you for listening. It helps. It really does.~
@1509 = ~Calimshite slavers.

Siene, an elven girl I rescued from the slavers a year ago, approached me in Amkethran. She bids me to help her rescue several of her sisters.~
@1510 = ~Calimshite slavers.

I let the slavers escape, together with their victims. I do not think we will meet again.~
@1511 = ~Calimshite slavers.

Siene was very upset with my decision to let the slavers go, and left. So much for my reward.~
@1512 = ~Calimshite slavers.

Siene left immediately after the fight, in tears. So much for my reward.~
@1513 = ~Calimshite slavers.

I encountered the slavers again. This time, not one escaped.~
@1514 = ~Calimshite slavers.

Finally, the women are free. Before leaving, Siene gave us her Boots of Speed. But somehow, I do not think it is over.~
@1515 = ~Calimshite slavers.

I refused to pay the slavers for Xan's freedom. After all, he is an Archmage, isn't he? He should be able to free himself in a day or two. I will probably return to Amkethran and see to him then.~
@1516 = ~Calimshite slavers.

I threatened the mercenary, who came for Xan's ransom, and he revealed Xan's location to me: Xan is in one of Amkethran's huts.~
@1517 = ~Calimshite slavers.

I bribed the mercenary, who came for Xan's ransom, and he revealed Xan's location to me: Xan is in one of Amkethran's huts.~
@1518 = ~Calimshite slavers.

I paid the required ransom, and the mercenary revealed Xan's location to me: Xan is in one of Amkethran's huts.~
@1519 = ~Calimshite slavers.

The slavers took Xan with them in exchange for the girls' freedom. I suppose I should wait for someone to come and demand the ransom.~
@1520 = ~Calimshite slavers.

I have chosen a direct assault, and now all the slavers are dead. Unfortunately, all three elven girls are dead, as well.~
@1521 = ~Calimshite slavers.

I paid the mercenaries a solid sum, and they walked away. The rest was easy, and now the women are free.~
@1522 = ~Calimshite slavers.

I do not know how Xan and others managed to pay the ransom without touching the party coffers, but I am free again. Somehow, though, I do not think it is over.~ 
@1523 = ~Calimshite slavers.

Xan has a feeling that the slavers are going to pass through Amkethran again. It can be a good idea to return there and to check it out.~
@1524 = ~(Xan sighs and slowly draws you into an embrace, the tip of his nose against the tip of your ear. He does not say anything, and lets you go shortly afterwards.)~
@1525 = ~(He takes your hand, and starts tracing small circles on your palm. His touch is very light, but is somehow calming and comforting just the same.)~
@1526 = ~(Xan looks at you questioningly, and opens his mouth to say something. His breath seems to catch again, however, so he simply kisses you on the cheek instead.)~
@1527 = ~(He approaches you from behind, and for almost a minute stands absolutely still. Then slowly, hesitantly, he reaches out and strokes your hair.)~
@1528 = ~(Xan smiles, a little more widely than he normally does, and presents you with a red rose. He immediately retreats, and you get a glimpse of his face coloring rapidly.)~
@1529 = ~(His face is ashen and tired, but he looks at you and manages a fond smile. It is gone all too soon, however, and he turns away without a word.)~
@1530 = ~(He takes your hand and gives it a gentle squeeze.)~
@1531 = ~(His slender fingers run up and down your spine, settling on your waist. They linger there for a briefest of moments, but when he finally withdraws, any tiredness you may have felt is gone. Xan, however, rubs his forehead wearily.)~
@1532 = ~(Xan gives you a slight smile and offers his hand.)~
@1533 = ~(Xan takes a critical look at your injuries and bites his lip. He does not say anything, but his face is expressive enough.)~
@1534 = ~I fear "<CHARNAME>" no longer does you justice. A heroine? A legend? A... goddess? No... please, not that.~
@1535 = ~(He takes one resigned look at your surroundings and shakes his head in a familiar gesture that reads as "not now".)~
@1536 = ~(He quietly approaches you and puts his arms on your shoulderblades, massaging them gently. Then your shoulders, then soft, tender touch on your neck... but in the end, you hear a loud, lengthy sigh instead of a kiss.)~
@1537 = ~(His arm, slender and warm, wraps around your waist.)~
@1538 = ~(His face is sad and drawn, as always, but his eyes smile at you. In fact, this time you *definitely* saw a wink.)~
@1539 = ~(Xan tries and fails to conceal the fact that he's been... staring... very intently... at you again.)~
@1540 = ~(Your eyes meet, and suddenly with strange certainty you know what he is thinking about. Xan colors slightly.)~
@1541 = ~(He cautiously approaches you and very gently pulls you close, whispering endearments and sighing at the same time.)~
@1542 = ~Come whatever may... I am yours, <CHARNAME>.~
@1543 = ~(Xan nods to you and keeps walking. You notice strange sadness in his eyes, however - the sadness that lingered since the day the war with your siblings began.)~
@1544 = ~(Xan sighs and steps back.)~
@1545 = ~No, nothing. Although... perhaps later?~
@1546 = ~Excuse me, but... I do not think you can help me.~ [O#XAN000]
@1547 = ~My lord! Blessed be the Seldarine, my sisters are saved!~ [O#XANSI1]
@1548 = ~I am Siene. A year ago, you and your noble comrade freed me and my elven sisters, Diala and Minuwiel.~
@1549 = ~Oh - of course. (sigh) It is good to see you alive still.~
@1550 = ~I am well, but some of my sisters are not so fortunate.~
@1551 = ~The - the slavers continue their black trade, and more and more victims fall to them! I... (sob!) I cannot let it continue...~
@1552 = ~We must stop them, <CHARNAME>! Even Boo's whiskers quiver at the sight of such injustice!~
@1553 = ~Th-that's horrible! We should free them - all of them!~
@1554 = ~Cease yer whining, lass! Them slavers ain't gonna kill yer fillies... before they have their way with 'em. Har har!~
@1555 = ~That's disgusting! Like... like Irenicus all over again.~
@1556 = ~I would have thought it beneath you, <PRO_BROTHERSISTER>. Or do you disagree?~
@1557 = ~There is little you can do alone, child. You have come to ask for assistance, have you not?~
@1558 = ~Why... yes. I had three warriors with me, but they are dead... the slavers are not without their defenses. Though they felled some of their mercenaries, it was no use. I feel horrible - I asked them to help, and now... Oh, it is just so hopeless!~
@1559 = ~(sigh) I could not agree more. <CHARNAME>, what shall we do?~
@1560 = ~It is good to see you again, Siene. I shall help you, of course. What needs to be done?~
@1561 = ~I do not remember you, Siene, but I shall help you gladly.~
@1562 = ~We shall help her, yes.~
@1563 = ~I do not know this woman, and I do not like the way you look at her!~
@1564 = ~We cannot help you, Siene. Our own mission is too important.~
@1565 = ~Can you wait for us here? We must rest and buy supplies, first.~
@1566 = ~Oh, that's a relief!~
@1567 = ~You are here! But... Lord Xan? I... I do not think we will be successful without the moonblade wielder with us. Bring him, please.~ [O#XANSI2]
@1568 = ~The caravan is due to pass through Amkethran at any moment. Come with me.~
@1569 = ~Finally, you are here! Will... will you help?~ [O#XANSI2]
@1570 = ~We will. Lead on.~
@1571 = ~Not yet, Siene.~
@1572 = ~I... I see. I shall be waiting here, then. Please, hurry!~
@1573 = ~(sigh) <CHARNAME>, you are not serious, are you? If you know of a recipe for a man to be next to you and still have, ah, eyes for other women, I'd be most curious to hear it. But this is for later - for now we must decide whether we have time and resources to help this young woman or not.~
@1574 = ~I do not care for her and her 'sisters'! No!~
@1575 = ~Perhaps later. I do not want to think of it now.~
@1576 = ~I am sorry, Xan. We shall help her.~
@1577 = ~We will. What is the situation, Siene?~
@1578 = ~I... I will not be able to help my kin on my own... The caravan is going to pass through Amkethran very soon, however. I will not be able to wait for too long.~
@1579 = ~I am afraid I have nothing to entice you with... except for what little I have. My Boots of Speed? Or some gold? But I would give anything for you to help, believe me.~
@1580 = ~Please, soon they will pass through, and I'll be helpless to aid my sisters on my own! Please, come. Come, and we will stop their dark ways once and for all.~
@1581 = ~Move it, you three! Or do you want to be given to local mercenaries, first? This can be arranged - they'll queue up for your flesh, I joke not. So - move it!~
@1582 = ~Stop! You will go nowhere!~
@1583 = ~(sigh) Oh, Seldarine, now it begins...~
@1584 = ~What? Another two slaves into the fold? Two... three... wait. You are <CHARNAME>, aren't you?~
@1585 = ~Yes, I am. What of it?~
@1586 = ~<CHARNAME> of Candlekeep. NOT at your service.~
@1587 = ~What does it matter? You are dead meat.~
@1588 = ~I am sure I have no idea who you are talking about.~
@1589 = ~I know of <PRO_HIMHER>, but I am not <PRO_HESHE>.~
@1590 = ~Do not bother, <CHARNAME>. I know who you are and *what* you are.~
@1591 = ~I am Khalid of Calimshan, and I have no quarrel with you.~
@1592 = ~You need not quarrel with us to die. Standing in my <PRO_BROTHERSISTER>'s way is enough.~
@1593 = ~Minsc is puzzled. How can this evil slaver bear the proud name of our fallen comrade?~
@1594 = ~I have a strange feeling that by revealing your name, you made a *very* bad mistake.~
@1595 = ~Such filth, taking Khalid's name... I will tear out your throat for sullying it! Thank Silvanus he is dead and cannot hear you!~
@1596 = ~The other Khalid is dead? So, the name did not protect him well enough, eh? "Khalid" means "immortal", you know. Perhaps he should have stayed in Calimshan... should have helped us with a safer business instead of going off with you heroic types.~
@1597 = ~How dare you - I will - I will...~
@1598 = ~Enough. I wish to speak to your leader.~
@1599 = ~You, however, look as if you were disposed most aggressively, and it disturbs me.~
@1600 = ~Disturbs YOU? What about these poor women you have abducted?!~
@1601 = ~Do not worry, it will not disturb you for long. Actually, soon nothing will disturb you anymore.~
@1602 = ~I will not tolerate you maligning Khalid's name! Die, filth!~
@1603 = ~I am sure we can come to a compromise.~
@1604 = ~No, no, you are mistaken. Proceed on your way, please.~
@1605 = ~Of course, of course. You will tear out our lungs, pierce our black hearts with a pike and feed our bodies to the crows.~
@1606 = ~(cough) There is something... very familiar in these words.~
@1607 = ~Well, let me explain it to you, <CHARNAME>, if you haven't understood already: first move you make will end in my mercenaries' hands slipping, and these girls falling dead. All three of them.~
@1608 = ~Kill me, if you wish, just do not harm them! They are just girls!~
@1609 = ~(sigh) Believe me, I do not care. I am a busy man, I see many young girls. They are for trade, nothing more.~
@1610 = ~I do not see a compromise, <CHARNAME>. You see, we can give up the women, but who will guarantee you will not attack us afterwards?~
@1611 = ~You can give us your word, or threaten us. Or pay us. It will not change anything: once the women are safe, you will be sure to attack us. I know it, you know it, and I know you know it.~
@1612 = ~And we know that you know that we know... Ahem. (sigh) Never mind. Please, continue. I think I know where it is heading...~
@1613 = ~You can attack us, of course. And we will undoubtedly die. But before it, we are going to kill the women, and not one shall escape! Or we could take someone else instead of them, to guarantee our safety. Think of it.~
@1614 = ~I... can come instead of them...~
@1615 = ~No, girl, you cannot. If I were in <CHARNAME>'s place, I'd decide three lives were better than one, and leave you to die without hesitation. <CHARNAME> can count. So I do not trust this solution.~
@1616 = ~<CHARNAME>, if you come aside with me for a moment...~
@1617 = ~I...~
@1618 = ~I do not want to see these women dead. But neither do I wish that anyone in the party would risk themselves, especially you. After all, Siene approached me, did she not? So, it would be only fair if I volunteer as a hostage.~
@1619 = ~Failing that... the fight is out of the question, I hope... I have another solution. The two slavers are powerful, there is no doubt about that, but the real power lies with their mercenaries. If we pay *them*, there is a very good chance to free the women without any bloodshed.~
@1620 = ~And last, but not least - I am an Enchanter, <CHARNAME>. I can try to take their group under my control, should you wish it. I cannot guarantee success, however.~
@1621 = ~You there! It is time. If we do not move now, Balthazar's mercenaries may interfere, and neither of us would want... causalities. So, what do you suggest? We are open to negotiations.~
@1622 = ~All of you? Very well. I am willing to make your mercenaries an offer they will not refuse.~
@1623 = ~You need a hostage, don't you? Well, I am ready to become one.~
@1624 = ~Xan here has volunteered to become your hostage.~
@1625 = ~(quietly) Xan, it is time for your spell. Enchant them, and quickly!~
@1626 = ~There is no solution. We will fight.~
@1627 = ~You may go and take the women. I do not care.~
@1628 = ~Why, I certainly did not expect such generosity out of you. But I will take advantage of it now, if you do not mind.~
@1629 = ~No!~
@1630 = ~<CHARNAME>, are you out of your mind? Do you know what he is going to do to these women, once they reach Calimshan, or do you simply not care?~
@1631 = ~Indeed, I do not care.~
@1632 = ~Tell you what, Khalid. Let us find a compromise.~
@1633 = ~You are right, Xan. I am sorry, dear slavers, but now you die.~
@1634 = ~Good to know that you are a <PRO_MANWOMAN> of such magnificent indifference. And now, if you do not mind... Move it, you whores!~
@1635 = ~(sigh) <CHARNAME>... why?~
@1636 = ~You - you - oh, Seldarine... (sob!)~
@1637 = ~Goodbye.~
@1638 = ~You... what? You DARE? I forbid - ~
@1639 = ~Yeah?~
@1640 = ~Yeah. One thousand to each of you.~
@1641 = ~Will two thousand be all right for each of you?~
@1642 = ~Three thousand - for everyone!~
@1643 = ~Ah, what the hell! Five thousand for all of you - I can afford that!~
@1644 = ~I... do not have this much with me.~
@1645 = ~Forget it. I changed my mind.~
@1646 = ~We are going to be paid that anyway. Well, nearly that. No.~
@1647 = ~Nice to see such a *praiseworthy* example of loyalty. Vel, we'll have to do something about this, once we are home.~
@1648 = ~Two thousand? Twice more than we...~
@1649 = ~You have a deal, <PRO_MANWOMAN>! Give us the money, and we go!~
@1650 = ~Thieves! You cannot - ~
@1651 = ~Watch us.~
@1652 = ~Three thousand - yes! Yes!!~
@1653 = ~You are not kidding? Five thousand for *each* of us?!~
@1654 = ~Watch us. For five thousand I'll sell my own kids, just so you know.~
@1655 = ~We cannot protect the goods now, so we will leave. But we will meet again, you can be sure of that.~
@1656 = ~And the next meeting shall be our last one. In every sense.~
@1657 = ~Well, well. *This* alternative I like.~
@1658 = ~Strip. I will not take a fully equipped warrior.~
@1659 = ~Now come. The women will stay with your companions, to deal with as they see fit.~
@1660 = ~Har! I like that!~
@1661 = ~We will take care of them, <CHARNAME>, do not worry. And we will free you.~
@1662 = ~What - just what are you going to do to <PRO_HIMHER>?!~
@1663 = ~*grin* Do not worry. A messenger will come to you soon. And, believe me, we can imagine the score of an adequate ransom. You will be able to pay - should you want to.~
@1664 = ~Now come, and quickly! Keep an eye on the prisoner. And don't you harm a hair on <PRO_HISHER> head until I say so!~
@1665 = ~Truly? Well, well. I cannot say I dislike your offer, but will he even last until you bring the ransom?~
@1666 = ~The ransom? Seldarine, I am truly doomed... Who would want to... (sigh)~
@1667 = ~I will. You will return to us as soon as possible, I promise.~
@1668 = ~Xan, do you truly trust me so little? I will pay, and set you free.~
@1669 = ~Your sacrifice will not be forgotten, Xan.~
@1670 = ~I cannot allow you to go! It is too dangerous!~
@1671 = ~I trust you, but...~
@1672 = ~(sigh) Oh, never mind. Just take care of these women - and yourself. This life is too short.~
@1673 = ~Because it will be my last sacrifice, I doubt it not. Take care of yourself, <CHARNAME>: this life is too short.~
@1674 = ~I fear the choice is no longer mine or yours. Take care of yourself, <CHARNAME>: this life is too short.~
@1675 = ~Enough. You, mage - strip and come with us. Women - remain here. Mercenaries - ready your weapons. We go.~
@1676 = ~(quietly) Yes.~
@1677 = ~You will... will...~
@1678 = ~Seldarine, this is too hard... There are too many... I...~
@1679 = ~What was that?~
@1680 = ~Bah, no matter. One more 'accidental' move, however, and the women are dead, I promise you this. Shall we continue?~
@1681 = ~As I expected. As we all expected, didn't we, Vel? Prepare to die, girls!~
@1682 = ~Nooo!!!~
@1683 = ~Good. Now, if you have yet no other *lucrative* proposals, what shall we do?~
@1684 = ~I will become your hostage.~
@1685 = ~Xan will become your hostage.~
@1686 = ~(quietly) Xan, it is time to cast. Quickly!~
@1687 = ~Draw your weapons, and let us end this fast.~
@1688 = ~Stop here. I will need one man to go down and bring them an offer of ransom. And in the meanwhile...~
@1689 = ~I have a pretty good idea what to do with girls like you, of course, and so do my men - ~
@1690 = ~(chuckle) We do, chief. She's a pretty one, eh?~
@1691 = ~(sigh) Rather, you've been without female company for too long.~
@1692 = ~In case anybody failed to notice, she is a Bhaalspawn. If any one of you wishes to be ripped apart by an eight-foot thing with a full arsenal of teeth and claws, you are welcome to. Otherwise, no one is to touch her. Am I understood?~
@1693 = ~Yes, chief...~
@1694 = ~Do you need anything, <CHARNAME>?~
@1695 = ~I do not think so.~
@1696 = ~Your head on a silver plate, slaver!~
@1697 = ~Stop staring at me, all of you. I feel I need a bath already.~
@1698 = ~Let me go.~
@1699 = ~What... what are you going to do to me?~
@1700 = ~Killing the whole bunch of you would be a good start.~
@1701 = ~Very good. Then, we are all good and ready.~
@1702 = ~Ha. No, I do not think so.~
@1703 = ~Do not worry, <CHARNAME>. In a few seconds, you will stop noticing them... and everything else.~
@1704 = ~You will see. Though... Oh. No, you will not.~
@1705 = ~Switch <PRO_HIMHER> off. Discreetly, if you please.~
@1706 = ~Yes, chief.~
@1707 = ~<CHARNAME>!~
@1708 = ~Khalid sends his regards and asks for twenty thousand gold, if you wish to see your companion again... alive.~
@1709 = ~What! Are you mad, to demand such a sum from us?~
@1710 = ~No touching me share! If ye be a fool, 'tis yer business, not mine!~
@1711 = ~Are you mad, rivvil? It is much easier for us to find another mage. Of course, if <CHARNAME> does not act with revolting sentimentality again.~
@1712 = ~It is decided, I trust. The enchanter is now a slave. Saves me the trouble... Ahem. (What I meant, of course, is that no spellcaster could ever rival me, and now none ever will.)~
@1713 = ~You paid this sum for me already, and now you will have to pay for Xan. This is so unfair, isn't it? But we have no other choice... or do we?~
@1714 = ~I only do what I am told. What is your answer?~
@1715 = ~I will pay. Just return him to me.~
@1716 = ~What would you say if I offered five thousand to you, personally? Just help me get him back, and you are rich.~
@1717 = ~I am a Bhaalspawn! Unless you wish to die a *very* painful death, you will tell me where he is!~
@1718 = ~I am a Bhaalspawn! Unless you wish to die, you will tell me where he is!~
@1719 = ~No! You will die, then I will find your master, and kill him, too!~
@1720 = ~I do not have enough gold.~
@1721 = ~I do not care if he lives or dies. Tell your master that.~
@1722 = ~Oh. You've actually decided to pay?~
@1723 = ~All right, then. Just go to the nearest hut in Amkethran, and your mage will be there. Simple, isn't it? So long.~
@1724 = ~Well...~
@1725 = ~I mean, five thousand is a lot of money, right? So, it's not even dishonorable. It's strictly business.~
@1726 = ~So, yeah, I can tell you where he is now.~
@1727 = ~They were sure you'd pay the ransom anyway, so they shoved him off into one of the huts in Amkethran. Just look around.~
@1728 = ~(gulp) Please... not the Slayer! Not... not...~
@1729 = ~I will tell you! Just... do not kill me!~
@1730 = ~They were sure you'd pay the ransom anyway, so they shoved him off into one of the huts in Amkethran. Just go there, and I'll... I'll... just go.~
@1731 = ~I do not care. I have instructions. If you do not wish to pay, Khalid will sell him as a bed slave, or collar him, so his magic will serve our masters. It is your choice.~
@1732 = ~I will pay, then.~
@1733 = ~I will pay five thousand to *you*, so you will return him. Use any means.~
@1734 = ~Do you know what I will do to you if you refuse to comply? Does the word "Slayer" sound familiar?~
@1735 = ~My answer is no. I cannot.~
@1736 = ~My answer is no. I do not want to.~
@1737 = ~Unfortunate. But it is your problem, not mine.~
@1738 = ~Fine. You will not see me again.~
@1739 = ~Sisters... you are free.~ [O#XANSI3]

@1747 = ~Do you wish to stay in the center of the Bhaalspawn wars, among drunken mercenaries and gathering armies? Seldarine, they are doomed.~
@1748 = ~We cannot. Balthazar's mercenaries are not to be trifled with... they can be worse than slavers, trust me.~
@1749 = ~Oh.~
@1750 = ~We must leave.~
@1751 = ~<CHARNAME>, I am not asking you to accompany us. You have done much for us already. Since I will be keeping pace with my sisters, I will not need these boots any longer - take them.~
@1752 = ~Seldarine bless you... whoever you are.~
@1753 = ~We would have died without you...~
@1754 = ~Farewell.~
@1755 = ~<CHARNAME>? Again? By the gods, this is growing tiresome!~
@1756 = ~I quite agree. Time to put to end to this, don't you think?~
@1757 = ~You will not escape today!~
@1758 = ~Why did you let them go? Why did I even ask you?~ [O#XANSI4]
@1759 = ~I do not understand... I can't!~
@1760 = ~They are dead... all dead...~ [O#XANSI5]
@1761 = ~Perhaps there was indeed no other way. At least, these men will never enslave anybody else.~
@1762 = ~But, Seldarine, three... three lives taken...~
@1763 = ~I cannot stay here any longer. Excuse me.~
@1764 = ~I wanted to talk to you about Siene and those elven girls...~
@1765 = ~But of course. Do you wish to ask me something?~
@1766 = ~Are you forced to do all these noble things, like saving the slaves?~
@1767 = ~Will the line of elves, asking for your help, ever end?~
@1768 = ~I just wondered how you coped with all these requests for help, like Siene's.~
@1769 = ~Just wondering what you think about all this.~
@1770 = ~Did you want to help her?~
@1771 = ~Well. It's a difficult question.~
@1772 = ~Of course, I wanted to help Siene. No sentient being, least of one of the People, should be sold as cattle. Especially as young and innocent as the girls we saw.~
@1773 = ~But you are right... yes. I did not see how I could refuse, even if I wanted to refuse. The blade, judging my deeds, aside, it is simply unthinkable.~
@1774 = ~A moonblade wielder does not refuse to help; he throws himself into the fray, even if it costs him his life. *Especially* if it costs him his life, as some of my young brethren tend to think.~
@1775 = ~I do not hear requests like Siene's very often, as you might have noticed. Still, I know they will not end until I die. I am so tired sometimes, <CHARNAME>.~
@1776 = ~But you are determined to live and die by the book, aren't you?~
@1777 = ~Have you ever thought of ending this?~
@1778 = ~It is hard to be a hero, I agree.~
@1779 = ~Poor dear.~
@1780 = ~Rather, by Corellon's rules. But...~
@1781 = ~Of course I have. You have heard my "lie down and die" often enough, I trust.~
@1782 = ~<CHARNAME>... Look at me. Am I a hero?~
@1783 = ~(snort) Very funny, thank you.~
@1784 = ~Protection, knowledge, guidance... I am a poor protector, and a worthless guardian - your many brushes with death proved it well enough. My knowledge is pathetic, as well, the recent events showed it.~
@1785 = ~But for some reason, my moonblade retains the light. Corellon wants me to continue. And I will. After all, the choice was mine only once - many years ago, when my fingers closed on my moonblade's hilt. Now I can only - ~
@1786 = ~ - complain.~
@1787 = ~ - whine.~
@1788 = ~ - sigh.~
@1789 = ~What?~
@1790 = ~Smile?~
@1791 = ~It sounds like it, doesn't it? No, I do not. I simply state the facts.~
@1792 = ~(sigh)~
@1793 = ~Oh. A... a novel thought.~
@1794 = ~Still, we save lives. Even one life makes a difference. And the big picture is not for me to ponder on. Perhaps for you, if in the end...~
@1795 = ~But I do not want to think of it.~
@1796 = ~I wish local bandits would stop using our home as their staging point. But nobody asks our opinion. They just come, knives and all, and we hide behind our beds and pray they do not come again.~
@1797 = ~Slavers often come here. I know they are slavers, 'cause they bring bound women here, and everything. Are you slavers, too?~
@1798 = ~(sigh)~ [O#XAN000]
@1799 = ~Finally. The world will breathe a little easier.~
@1800 = ~Thank you for returning here, <CHARNAME>. I am grateful.~
@1801 = ~I wish to make your men an offer they will not refuse.~
@1802 = ~You will sully my Khalid's name no longer!~
@1803 = ~Thank you, <CHARNAME>. This needed to be done.~
@1804 = ~You look especially sad today. What is it?~
@1805 = ~I saw you reading a letter. Who was it from?~
@1806 = ~Do you remember our conversation in Baldur's Gate? I spoke of my cousin Erevain to you, if you recall.~
@1807 = ~Yes, he died in Icewind Dale, didn't he?~
@1808 = ~Yes, of course. Were you thinking about him, then?~
@1809 = ~Erevain? Who is that?~
@1810 = ~Alas, he did indeed. Perhaps you would like to learn more?~
@1811 = ~Mostly, yes. Of him, and of my travels.~
@1812 = ~My kin and cousin, and an adventurer, as well.~
@1813 = ~I was saddened when I learnt of his death, but Icewind Dale was a long way away, and the mercenaries who brought back his sword and diary assured me that he was buried properly, if by human tradition.~
@1814 = ~However, twenty years later I found myself traveling near Kuldahar. A windy night, snow under my feet - my shoes became wet within moments, of course - and darkness. And as if I wanted things to become worse still, I stumbled into a nearest tavern and explained that I was searching for my cousin's grave.~
@1815 = ~For some reason, the owner looked at me with respect. Perhaps he thought I was as reckless and daring as my cousin was - the dwellers of those frozen lands value these qualities highly.~
@1816 = ~He lent me a lamp, and even went as far as to open the door for me, showing the way. It wasn't far.~
@1817 = ~The snow blinded my eyes, but I managed to read the words on the tomb. They were few.~
@1818 = ~Erevain Blacksheaf. Martyred Hero of Dragon's Eye. Died 1281.~
@1819 = ~I long stood over the grave. Not crying, not expecting anything. Just reading the inscription, over and over.~
@1820 = ~Nine words. Just nine words. He was much more than that.~
@1821 = ~Xan...~
@1822 = ~I am sorry.~
@1823 = ~Why did you travel there?~
@1824 = ~Do not say anything. It is all right... I meant - it is passable. Thank you.~
@1825 = ~Who's to say on whom the Fates smile, and on whom they play dirty tricks? But I wish I knew.~
@1826 = ~(sigh) Irrelevant. I was returning from a mission... but it meant so little, compared to his passing.~
@1827 = ~A letter from home, <CHARNAME>. Or, rather, a place I may very soon stop calling home.~
@1828 = ~Who was it from?~
@1829 = ~But you are an elf, and you wield a moonblade. How can it be?~
@1830 = ~From Evereska? What has happened?~
@1831 = ~From one of my mentors. He used to be a Greycloak, as well.~
@1832 = ~How? Easily.~
@1833 = ~Can you not guess? Saradush has happened.~
@1834 = ~I received this letter, while we were still in Suldanessellar. Eragrim writes: "Concerned about your station... the mission accomplished flawlessly... however, recent events... your infamous companion..."~
@1835 = ~It is hopeless. You just saved an entire city, and many of our kin. Yet, my superiors - for Eragrim represents them, in a way - are far from satisfied. Plainly said, this letter is a direct order for me to return. They do not trust me to travel with a savior of Suldanessellar, I see.~
@1836 = ~Xan, I cannot believe it. Are you actually defending me?~
@1837 = ~But if you received it long ago, and never acted, does it mean that you will stay?~
@1838 = ~So, what are you going to do?~
@1839 = ~So, I am your "infamous companion" now. Very nice.~
@1840 = ~You miss the point. I received this message during the festivities in your honor. However, now my kin would kill you on sight, one and all, for they are convinced you are a mass murderer and destroyer. Which, in turn, makes me an outcast. Do you understand my dilemma now?~
@1841 = ~I do. You are going to leave.~
@1842 = ~So, you are torn between duty and your personal allegiance?~
@1843 = ~What matters more to you: our cause, or your city?~
@1844 = ~No, Xan. I do not.~
@1845 = ~Cause? Our "cause", as you have eloquently called it, has always been the same: staying alive. Nothing else.~
@1846 = ~I am more than torn, <CHARNAME>. I am defeated. With each day, I lose more and more - and who could say I have gained something?~
@1847 = ~You have. Your new powers will protect Evereska for centuries of time.~
@1848 = ~Experience. It will always stay with you.~
@1849 = ~You have found friends, Xan.~
@1850 = ~My love.~
@1851 = ~Excellent. These centuries are to start immediately after my death in the next brawl, I presume?~
@1852 = ~Yes, even after I die. Which is likely to be tomorrow. Who will need my experience then?~
@1853 = ~For the next few days, I have. But soon, they will all head in different directions and never look back once. You know this as well as I.~
@1854 = ~It is a fragile thing, as I have told you before. And I fear the Fates have yet to pay us a visit.~
@1855 = ~But I apologize for my tone. I haven't rested much, recently; perhaps this was the cause. We are doomed, but perhaps things will get better, somehow.~
@1856 = ~After all, they cannot get any worse.~
@1857 = ~My own mother wanted to sacrifice me. Can you imagine this, Xan?~
@1858 = ~...~
@1859 = ~I... understand this is true: after all, why would you lie? Still, it sounds so monstrous I barely believe it. And - did she die?~
@1860 = ~Yes. Gorion killed her.~
@1861 = ~Solar explained that Harpers attacked Bhaal's priesthood, and slew them all. Gorion rescued me.~
@1862 = ~Probably.~
@1863 = ~Worse and worse. Ah - I am relieved that you are alive, certainly, but these events...~
@1864 = ~Would you want to listen about my mother?~
@1865 = ~Would you really tell me?~
@1866 = ~Yes, I would.~
@1867 = ~What was she like?~
@1868 = ~No, I do not think I want to know.~
@1869 = ~I understand. Of course.~
@1870 = ~If you should desire to talk about something else, anything else - talk to me.~
@1871 = ~She was a beauty - well, it is obvious she must have been, otherwise I would not be able to inherit her looks and master my art.~
@1872 = ~She had also had a gift of foresight: that was how she met my father, for they shared it. From my childhood years I remember that they barely talked at times, often stopping at mid-word: they understood each other that well.~
@1873 = ~She never wanted to become a diviner, however, and now I see why: her future, and my past, held too many sad things. The passing of my father... and their separation...~
@1874 = ~You know of it, do you not? When a moonblade wielder passes away, his soul belongs to the blade for as long as the blade lives. My mother is in Arvandor; the blade is here; my father is somewhere in between, and they are not destined to meet until the blade's tasks are done. Corellon knows when it will happen; likely long after my own death and imprisonment. Is it cruelty or necessity, I often wonder?~
@1875 = ~... I do not know what else to say. I wanted to comfort you at first, but now it feels as if you are about to comfort me. I am sorry.~
@1876 = ~It is fine. We needed each other's support, and it seems to me that we have got it.~
@1877 = ~As am I.~
@1878 = ~It is going to be all right.~
@1879 = ~Actually, no: I think you'll be fine on your own.~
@1880 = ~I think so. It is good to have you to talk to, I admit.~
@1881 = ~Hmm. I wonder, if I say "I am doomed", will you be absent-minded enough to repeat "As am I"? I dream of the moment sometimes, you know.~
@1882 = ~Same old <CHARNAME>... No, it isn't.~
@1883 = ~I will be, now. Thank you.~
@1884 = ~Though... do not tell anyone, but sometimes, *very* rarely, I hope that a day comes for a happy ending. Very rarely... like right now.~
@1885 = ~Ahem. But of course, we are all doomed.~
@1886 = ~Xan, I think I am sure about us now.~
@1887 = ~As am I.~
@1888 = ~(Xan takes a deep breath and steps up to you.)~ [O#XAN000]
@1889 = ~<CHARNAME>, do me a favor and remain alive today, will you? Not that my wishes matter, of course, but...~
@1890 = ~Please.~
@1891 = ~Xan, I wonder: why didn't you approach me about becoming... closer?~
@1892 = ~Will you stay with me tonight?~
@1893 = ~Will we bond?~
@1894 = ~I think of the times past, and I am afraid you will hurt me again.~
@1895 = ~Get away from me! I hate you!~
@1896 = ~We have not been together as lovers, true. Considering the circumstances, and... everything else... And this troubles you?~
@1897 = ~I just wonder why. Do you feel guilty?~
@1898 = ~I simply want to talk about it.~
@1899 = ~No, I am comfortable as we are.~
@1900 = ~Yes, it does.~
@1901 = ~Then we shall.~
@1902 = ~This is good to know, although... well, I am not sure as to how I should react. But in any case, I think there are words that need to be said.~
@1903 = ~Then let us talk.~
@1904 = ~Because... how shall I put it? Because "Let's have a drink and make love tonight, for tomorrow we may be dead!" might not be the best way to pose the question?~
@1905 = ~(groan) You still remember that night, don't you?~
@1906 = ~I don't know. I like the phrase.~
@1907 = ~Oh? And I thought you still felt guilty, as you should.~
@1908 = ~I appreciate your irony. But seriously, why?~
@1909 = ~While it flattered me to no end, I still do not think our first time should have been like this... though with you, one never can tell what is proper and what is not. But seriously, <CHARNAME>...~
@1910 = ~I am guilty, and, perhaps, somewhere deep inside, I will always be. But it is not the sole reason.~
@1911 = ~My profession involves emotions, but even if it did not, I know that healing takes time. And I have hurt you very deeply indeed. You need time, <CHARNAME>, even if you do not realize it.~
@1912 = ~Ironically, we do not have many days left, and destiny or death may take you from me at any moment... but I am willing to make time in this instance. Are you?~
@1913 = ~I... don't know.~
@1914 = ~Perhaps you are right. Just hold me, will you?~
@1915 = ~Time is of no importance. I simply do not want to take this step.~
@1916 = ~I am not sure I trust you enough.~
@1917 = ~What about the Slayer? Aren't you afraid of it?~
@1918 = ~I do not want to wait.~
@1919 = ~Come here. Whatever happens, I am not letting you go. (sigh) I am sorry, <CHARNAME>. This time, I mean it.~
@1920 = ~Then you will not. It is as simple as that. Ah, <CHARNAME>... just staying by your side is a miracle beyond imagining, don't you know this?~
@1921 = ~This is why I was talking about time. I do not know if 'prove' is the fitting word, but if I have to prove myself to you, I will.~
@1922 = ~I am, but the recent events have shown that your control is back, together with your soul.~
@1923 = ~Are you sure?~
@1924 = ~As sure as one can be.~
@1925 = ~No... perhaps not.~
@1926 = ~Well, I was not talking about "right now", of course!~
@1927 = ~Regardless, if you wish to... pursue the subject further, I am here for you. In this - and in everything else.~
@1928 = ~(chuckle) Well - I hope so. Even you cannot be *that* impatient. Or can you?~
@1929 = ~Then talk to me again, when you wish it. I will be here for you. In this - and in everything else.~
@1930 = ~Tonight, tomorrow, and for as long as you will have me, or so I hope. Why do you ask?~
@1931 = ~Xan, stop pretending you did not understand the question!~
@1932 = ~I am talking about tonight. About now. About us as a man and a woman.~
@1933 = ~I actually hoped *you'd* say the words! I feel as if I am chasing you!~
@1934 = ~This was all I needed to know. Thank you.~
@1935 = ~Oh, never mind.~
@1936 = ~I was not...~
@1937 = ~Oh - I am sorry. Keeping my mind busy about our inevitable demise does have its disadvantages, I admit. You were saying... ?~
@1938 = ~<CHARNAME>... do mine ears deceive me?~
@1939 = ~No, they do not.~
@1940 = ~You told me you were there for me. And now... I am here for you.~
@1941 = ~After all we've been through, I think you have earned it.~
@1942 = ~Not that I think you deserve it, but we might as well try.~
@1943 = ~They do. You are having hallucinations, my poor Xan. Goodnight.~
@1944 = ~Never mind, I said. I do not want to continue this conversation.~
@1945 = ~(sigh) And I hoped for precisely the opposite. We are doomed to these small misunderstandings, are we not? But... what you just said...~
@1946 = ~Wait... please.~
@1947 = ~So that's what being in Arvandor must feel like... to hold you, to kiss your hair, your neck... <CHARNAME>...~
@1948 = ~Nonsense, as I am sure I have told you before. There is no 'earning', or 'deserving', there are no 'prizes' - there are only you and me.~
@1949 = ~But that's that insufferable nature of mine - I am trying to lecture you on elven ways, whereas I should be on my knees or close. Or... yes, embracing your knees is more like it.~
@1950 = ~I... I know that you wish only to leave, but sit with me for a brief spell. I will ask for nothing more.~
@1951 = ~All right.~
@1952 = ~Xan... tell me a story.~
@1953 = ~I would rather retire.~
@1954 = ~I love you. Though, try as I might, I cannot find any words for the occasion, I still remember these. A'maelamin... will you have me?~
@1955 = ~You know, I just might.~
@1956 = ~Well, you knew you were doomed! Yes!~
@1957 = ~(sigh) What is the point?~
@1958 = ~I am sorry, Xan, but I have changed my mind. When all this is over, then...~
@1959 = ~No. Not today, at least.~
@1960 = ~I... I was so sure just now, and suddenly I am... not.~
@1961 = ~When I look at you now, I think of an elven princess, who lived long ago. She was elven, beautiful, ambitious, and she was divine. Much like a certain young lady, who now sits in front of me... though your divinity is dark and sinister, while she was blessed by the Seldarine.~
@1962 = ~She grew up, her mind sharp and her talents plentiful. Duty was not an alien concept to her, and neither were power and ambition. She waited to be given a chance. And she received it.~
@1963 = ~A human mage, Karsus, wished to grab hold of all magic that ever existed, and seized hold of the Weave, the mystic force that keeps us all alive in the Spirit. The goddess of Magic, terrified that her children would suffer, committed a ritual suicide, thus breaking Karsus' hold on the Weave.~
@1964 = ~However, by this very action, even worse damage was inflicted. For a few unspeakable moments, the Weave ceased to exist. Many elves lay near death, and for the existing mythals, the powerful objects that sustain Evereska and Evermeet, the consequences were severe indeed.~
@1965 = ~The moment to act had come. The princess, supported by her divine parent, stepped forward and proclaimed that her people needed a new hope. Deep in the forests of Tethyr, nine High Mages sacrificed their lives, and high at the treetops, a new city was created, protected by a new powerful mythal, blessed by Rillifane himself.~
@1966 = ~On that day, the princess had died, and the Queen of Suldanessellar was born.~
@1967 = ~She lives to this day, her ambitions fulfilled, her dreams real. But... is she happy?~
@1968 = ~Will you be, if you choose this path? But if you do, I will never know. Goodnight, <CHARNAME>.~
@1969 = ~(sigh) As you wish. I will not remind you of it tomorrow.~
@1970 = ~You know, all of a sudden it seems to me that we are not doomed, and never have been...~
@1971 = ~I understand.~
@1972 = ~I know the feeling. Here... I do not think that one of my stories is exactly what you need right now, but it is better than nothing. Listen.~
@1973 = ~<CHARNAME>! Seldarine, you are cruel. But - please, answer true this time.~
@1974 = ~Yes, melamin.~
@1975 = ~Well... maybe. There is only one way to find out, is there?~
@1976 = ~I do not know, Xan. I am sorry.~
@1977 = ~No, Xan.~
@1978 = ~Yes, and to have my head bitten off afterwards. But I am willing to risk it...~
@1979 = ~(You open your eyes to a very unusual sight: Xan, smiling in his sleep.)~ [O#XAN000]
@1980 = ~(keep watching him)~
@1981 = ~(sneak out quietly)~
@1982 = ~Xan...~
@1983 = ~Wake up! Time to die!~
@1984 = ~Bet you a hundred gold that you haven't memorized a single spell!~
@1985 = ~(At length, he opens his eyes.)~
@1986 = ~<CHARNAME>...~
@1987 = ~(sigh) Look at us now. A sane man would roll his eyes and try to get as far from us as it is mortally possible.~
@1988 = ~I wouldn't blame him. We Children of Bhaal are not to be trifled with.~
@1989 = ~Ah, what do these so-called "sane men" understand! Come here.~
@1990 = ~(snicker) He would indeed. Not long ago, I would join him.~
@1991 = ~<CHARNAME>, this tendency of yours to sneak out is about to become a habit, are you aware of it? Two times in a row - I'd be careful with it, if I were you.~
@1992 = ~But it matters not. You are with me...~
@1993 = ~Mmm? Oh. What - where - ~
@1994 = ~What, again? (sigh) Seldarine, it never ends, does it?~
@1995 = ~Oh.~
@1996 = ~I have, actually, though do not ask me how. But if you do not start getting dressed now, I may well forget them all, it is true.~
@1997 = ~(sigh) This I am aware of all too well.~
@1998 = ~Gladly.~
@1999 = ~Mmm? I can only hope that a present-day you will not.~
@2000 = ~Now, I'll be ready in a moment, but... was there something you wanted to say?~
@2001 = ~I liked the last night.~
@2002 = ~I am still unsure whether I made a mistake or not.~
@2003 = ~Why did you agree right away? I thought you'd insist I needed more time.~
@2004 = ~Yes. I missed the romance part: flowers, diamonds, wine...~
@2005 = ~Xan, what if we have a child?~
@2006 = ~I love you.~
@2007 = ~No, nothing.~
@2008 = ~Ah... yes...~
@2009 = ~Do forgive me: I am lost for words once again.~
@2010 = ~I do not have the heart to cite it as a mistake... as you might imagine. But if you deem it was an error, I will accept your judgment.~
@2011 = ~Nevertheless... thank you. It was a wonderful night.~
@2012 = ~I am but a mortal man, <CHARNAME>, not a vessel of virtue. I might be able to fight your enemies - from time to time, until the inevitable comes - but I am unable to fight you, and the desire you stir.~
@2013 = ~I'd say that you, as we all, have seen more than your share of diamonds, drank more than your share of glasses, and tramped on more than your share of flowers. But that would be unfair of me, of course.~
@2014 = ~We shall think of something, I promise.~
@2015 = ~I will remain by your side - for both of you. Even if you do not trust me in everything else, trust me in this.~
@2016 = ~And I - you. And so strongly, at that...~
@2017 = ~Then I will.~
@2018 = ~Thank you.~
@2019 = ~But that is for another time. For now, we march on. And... thank you for this wonderful night.~
@2020 = ~The day this ordeal is over - if you wish it. Building a true bond takes from days to months, whereas we have little in the way of time now.~
@2021 = ~Worse, with you being the central figure of this war, your destiny may indeed put you in Bhaal's place in the end. In this case, a bond will not serve you, and will most certainly kill me. Not that I'll have anything to live for then, of course.~
@2022 = ~Wait, <CHARNAME>, and I will wait with you. Next to you. By your side...~
@2023 = ~Talk to me. I cannot promise your fears will disappear entirely, but I will listen.~
@2024 = ~It started at Spellhold. I could not believe that all we've built disappeared in a moment.~
@2025 = ~I felt so numb and shocked on the day you abandoned me...~
@2026 = ~It is hopeless. You may listen now, but what will happen in a day? In a year?~
@2027 = ~There is no point. It is over, Xan.~
@2028 = ~Please, <CHARNAME>. You can always send me away, or ask me to leave you alone. But here and now, you are in pain, and I only wish to lessen it. Tell me.~
@2029 = ~All right. When you stopped talking to me, I felt as if I was walking in a nightmare.~
@2030 = ~These are dreadful memories. We were so happy, and suddenly, you turned cold.~
@2031 = ~No. Leave me be.~
@2032 = ~I will, for now. But please, think on it - before giving up on us.~
@2033 = ~(sigh) Yes. Not to mention that your situation was dire enough already.~
@2034 = ~Yes! I had just lost my soul!~
@2035 = ~How could you! I needed you so much, especially after all this, and you - you!~
@2036 = ~Irenicus started breaking me piece by piece, and you finished it for him.~
@2037 = ~I was betrayed twice: by Saemon and by you.~
@2038 = ~I was betrayed twice: by Yoshimo and by you.~
@2039 = ~It was.~
@2040 = ~I know. And I barely listened to you those days...~
@2041 = ~I tried to talk to you, but it was like talking to the wall.~
@2042 = ~I abased myself before you, because I truly did not understand what had gone wrong.~
@2043 = ~I could not believe it was only because of the Slayer. I tried to recall where I must have said or done something, and kept doing it without end...~
@2044 = ~And despite it all, I still loved you.~
@2045 = ~Seldarine... <CHARNAME>, if listening to you is so painful, how much hurt must you have experienced?~
@2046 = ~It was too much. Together with the loss of my soul, it was just too much...~
@2047 = ~Every morning I woke up and remembered anew that you were no longer with me. It was the worst of tortures; Irenicus' didn't even come close.~
@2048 = ~And it lasted for a very long time. Can you imagine how I must have felt in the Underdark?~
@2049 = ~You could have been there for me, but you were cold as a statue. Even after your mission was fulfilled - with my help.~
@2050 = ~And worse, I actually wanted to leave. To escape and to forget...~
@2051 = ~Exactly. You did not care about my feelings in the slightest.~
@2052 = ~I tried to make you change your mind, but it was hopeless.~
@2053 = ~Once, you even said you had forgotten. It was so unbelievingly callous.~
@2054 = ~I was so relieved when you said you would not...~
@2055 = ~I know. I know...~
@2056 = ~I know...~
@2057 = ~<CHARNAME>, what you went through... was impossible. And saying "I love you" after all this seems like a sacrilege.~
@2058 = ~But I will say it regardless. I love you. I need you, I want you by my side, and I cannot imagine a life without you - I do not wish to.~
@2059 = ~I understand you, and you understand me more than anyone else. And day by day, I hope that your pain will go, and your trust will return. These are plain words... but I can say no other.~
@2060 = ~It feels much better, now. I am glad you listened.~
@2061 = ~And I love you.~
@2062 = ~Thank you. But I am still in pain.~
@2063 = ~It does not help, Xan. Sometimes I think nothing ever will.~
@2064 = ~Forgive me. Forgive me...~
@2065 = ~(sigh) No, I really should not start it now. We need to go. Come - and thank you.~
@2066 = ~I can only remain by your side, hope that time is my ally, and pray you do not fall in battle. I can do little else.~
@2067 = ~But whatever our future will bring, I am glad that you have told me all this, painful as it was. And, though it means little, once again - forgive me.~
@2068 = ~You... you are addressing me, are you not?~
@2069 = ~Yes, you! You've had it too easy for too long, but you will not play with my heart again!~
@2070 = ~Nobody else has abandoned me in Spellhold, as far as I know!~
@2071 = ~Never mind. I am not myself these days.~
@2072 = ~It happens. You scared me senseless, however.~
@2073 = ~I am not going to. What is your intent, <CHARNAME>?~
@2074 = ~I want you to pay.~
@2075 = ~Do you know how much it hurts? No, of course not. You do not understand my pain at all, do you?~
@2076 = ~I feel cheated, somehow. I suffered for so long, and you just asked me for forgiveness, and there I was, ready and waiting.~
@2077 = ~True. Do continue.~
@2078 = ~I will doubtlessly start another round of exclamations by saying this, but I will risk it anyway: I know what you mean. And I dreaded the moment you'd bring it up.~
@2079 = ~I know of your pain, <CHARNAME>. I am not devoid enough of emotion not to sense it: quite the contrary.~
@2080 = ~And it indeed sounds too easy: I approached you, asked for your forgiveness, and it came.~
@2081 = ~(sigh) What should I do? I want you to rest easier, I want you to know that I am with you, and for you - and I want you to believe it. What should I say?~
@2082 = ~I do not know. I love you, but I hate the way you have behaved. I really, really do.~
@2083 = ~I am not sure. It is just - I am so angry at you sometimes, you have no idea.~
@2084 = ~Wait. Be gentle with me. Show that you care.~
@2085 = ~Be there for me - every day, every hour.~
@2086 = ~Swear to me. Give me a promise that you will bond with me, marry me - that you will never again as much as think of leaving.~
@2087 = ~(sigh) I know. Well, in this case... I may shock you, but still: now that I know of it, express yourself however you wish. Shout, cry, call me names... oh, the language I am sure to hear... but never mind. As for me - I will survive. Somehow.~
@2088 = ~I will. I will...~
@2089 = ~(Xan slowly, gingerly takes your hand and brings it to his lips.)~
@2090 = ~I will.~
@2091 = ~<CHARNAME>, even a master enchanter cannot control his thoughts all the time - oh. (sigh) I am sorry. It was a bad start, was it not?~
@2092 = ~I cannot swear on my moonblade: it involves the spirits of others. But Corellon hears me - in this pathetic time that we have left, and beyond the veil, I am yours.~
@2093 = ~And thinking of leaving... it is not at all entertaining, I assure you. Not to mention impossible.~
@2094 = ~There. Do you... feel better?~
@2095 = ~Well, maybe. A little.~
@2096 = ~Thank you, Xan. I do.~
@2097 = ~I do not know.~
@2098 = ~Not really. But perhaps it will come later.~
@2099 = ~A relief. For a moment, I was scared I lost you forever. This poor heart of mine has nearly stopped... but it does not matter. Come, melamin.~
@2100 = ~Hopefully, it will get better. (sigh) I know that hope is pointless, but with you, I cannot help it.~
@2101 = ~Xan, I am willing to give you a chance. But soon, I will approach you to talk about the times past, and woe to you, if your answers do not satisfy.~
@2102 = ~Thank you. I... will do my best not to disappoint.~
@2103 = ~I think that I trust you completely now.~
@2104 = ~Oh? This is something to celebrate, surely. (sigh) I hoped to hear these words earlier, however.~
@2105 = ~Earlier? Hmph! That's gratitude for you, I see.~
@2106 = ~Considering what has happened before, be grateful that you *have* heard them.~
@2107 = ~Healing takes time. You said so yourself.~
@2108 = ~I know. You were living on the edge these days, were you not?~
@2109 = ~I am grateful. But sharp words are the only defense I have left, and these days, I sometimes use them without thinking. I... apologize.~
@2110 = ~I did, I know. Still...~
@2111 = ~It was hard, harder than I imagined. When I asked you for a chance, I meant it truthfully - a chance to talk to you, to be with you was all I needed then.~
@2112 = ~But as time passed, I realized I could not live with this uncertainty: to wait for the blow to fall, for you to leave me - if only emotionally - at any moment. Perhaps then, I finally understood what you must have felt.~
@2113 = ~I said I trust you, but it does not necessarily mean we are together forever.~
@2114 = ~It is behind us now. We are together, and this is certain.~
@2115 = ~Now you understand.~
@2116 = ~My poor Xan...~
@2117 = ~I know. Your destiny will catch up with you, a prince on a white horse will appear from around the corner, an arrow will find my throat... We are, of course, doomed.~
@2118 = ~(sigh) For how long, dearest? It is not as if we are in safety, and my moonblade and your heritage have all of a sudden decided to stop gracing us with their company.~
@2119 = ~I do.~
@2120 = ~Rather, my poor <CHARNAME>... But you are not poor. You are beautiful.~
@2121 = ~If only we had more time...~
@2122 = ~But whatever the future carries - thank you. I may die tomorrow, but today I shall breathe a little easier. And you? How do you feel?~
@2123 = ~Calm and happy. And very much willing to nestle into your arms.~
@2124 = ~I am all right, I suppose.~
@2125 = ~Sad, for some odd reason.~
@2126 = ~I guess I feel relief, too.~
@2127 = ~Angry, baffled, agitated... I don't know.~
@2128 = ~Oh, this I shall gladly help you with. Mmm... so that's what happiness smells like...~
@2129 = ~Do not look at me like this! We are... still... doomed. But don't we deserve a brief respite somewhere?~
@2130 = ~(sigh) Then it is most definitely time to go.~
@2131 = ~Together...~
@2132 = ~(sigh) Which has suspiciously much to do with my words, I gather. I am sorry. Even now, when I should be the happiest of men, I am not.~
@2133 = ~But perhaps we shall have our happy ending, after all?~
@2134 = ~We are two of a kind, are we not?~
@2135 = ~Shhh... it will go. Here... give me your hand... and come closer. (sigh) Yes, you have guessed correctly: I was intending to lure you into my arms all along, if only for a moment. But I hope you do feel better, now.~
@2136 = ~Come. Let us see what the future has in store for us... though, to tell you the truth, I'd rather remain ignorant.~
@2137 = ~He is a fanatic, <CHARNAME>. It is hopeless.~
@2138 = ~I... <CHARNAME>?~ [O#XAN000]
@2139 = ~Yes, this is me.~
@2140 = ~Are you all right?~
@2141 = ~So, did it work?~
@2142 = ~Good to see you alive.~
@2143 = ~This I see. But the blade...~
@2144 = ~More or less, I suppose. Weak, but rather relieved to be alive.~
@2145 = ~It certainly glows brighter than it did moments before. Let me see...~
@2146 = ~Strangely enough, I share the sentiment.~
@2147 = ~Yes... yes. With Corellon's blessing, it has revealed more of its potential to me. So I might be on the right path, after all... or, perhaps, it is a chance to redeem myself?~
@2148 = ~Let us go, then, and see. Not that there is any point, of course - but somehow, I am curious.~
@2149 = ~You are much more powerful now. Shouldn't your moonblade grant you more abilities, as well?~
@2150 = ~I believe so. I have been thinking about it, myself... but it was almost as if I needed guidance from without - yours.~
@2151 = ~Stand by me, <CHARNAME>. I am almost sure the blade will heed my plea, this time, but I feel fear just the same.~
@2152 = ~Xan, about that young paladin...~
@2153 = ~I am both acutely curious and extremely disinterested in what you have to say. Can you imagine such a phenomena?~
@2154 = ~I suppose. In any case, it was a mistake.~
@2155 = ~I might have feelings for him.~
@2156 = ~Will you forgive me?~
@2157 = ~You hurt me. I wanted to hurt you in return.~
@2158 = ~Perfectly understandable, though it does not make it any less painful.~
@2159 = ~Well, then, you know what to do, should you want to get rid of me.~
@2160 = ~I do love you, and you know it. Let us go.~
@2161 = ~Nothing happened between us.~
@2162 = ~Nothing whatsoever? I disbelieve it, I'm afraid.~
@2163 = ~Poor soul. It could easily have been me, I suppose. A mad shadow wandering the halls, companions killed and sanity lost. Is there anything we can do for you, mellonamin?~
@2164 = ~Tamorlin Greyleaf, is it? The famous adventurer who left Evereska ten years ago? Your wife and son are still waiting for you, in case you are wondering.~
@2165 = ~Alive... alive, you say? I... I must go. I must return to them! Where am I?~
@2166 = ~Bring me Xan, my soulmate.~
@2167 = ~Here we are. The ultimate choice, yet I do not know what to say.~ [O#XAN297]
@2168 = ~I love you, Xan. Never forget that.~
@2169 = ~You, at a loss for words? We're doomed.~
@2170 = ~I am so sorry, Xan.~
@2171 = ~I don't, either.~
@2172 = ~And I will always love you. On the Planes or amidst the stars, among assassins and queens, awake or in the deepest reverie - you are my soul, Estel'amin.~ [O#XAN306]
@2173 = ~We are, and I perhaps more than you know... but this is not the time for self-pity, should you leave. This is your time. Your pinnacle.~ [O#XAN307]
@2174 = ~Choose what your heart feels is right. You are what the Fates made you; it would be foolish to stumble and fall on the last step.~ [O#XAN308]
@2175 = ~Or perhaps not? I cannot advise you, love. Just step forward - and do what you know you must.~ [O#XAN309]
@2176 = ~And here we are. The greatest adventure begins.~ [O#XAN298]
@2177 = ~How strange. I have the whole of the Realms - except you.~ [O#XAN299]
@2178 = ~And you have the entire Multiverse - but not me.~ [O#XAN300]
@2179 = ~Shall we meet again, I wonder? If I have to cross the Planes for you, I will.~ [O#XAN310]
@2180 = ~Shine brightly, my star.~ [O#XAN305]
@2181 = ~(It seems that Xan's heart and mind are focused on you again.)~ [O#XAN000]
@2182 = ~Even the First of the Seldarine took notice. Corellon sent you and your bondmate warnings in your dreams, and you heeded them. Even now, the gods are watching.~
@2183 = ~Is it just me, or is the lighting a little bit lacking?~ [O#XAN284]
@2184 = ~Personally, I'd rather get rid of the statues.~
@2185 = ~Hey! Get your own pocket plane, don't badmouth mine!~
@2186 = ~Good for intimacy.~
@2187 = ~Everyone's a critic.~
@2188 = ~If protruding arms of demons get you in the mood, certainly.~
@2189 = ~You think we could sell them at an auction, maybe? Cyric would be interested. Or maybe Bane. Hmm. Talona, perhaps?~
@2190 = ~But I digress, as I always do, these days.~
@2191 = ~Hm. Let's see how you like it after sleeping here for a tenday or two, oh mighty Daughter of Bhaal.~
@2192 = ~Your own plane. How do you feel about that?~
@2193 = ~I'd rather have a palace. With a pool.~
@2194 = ~I want a bigger one, of course!~
@2195 = ~Not very comfortable. It's not what I would've wanted for myself.~
@2196 = ~It's all right, I guess. Now, if only someone kills Cespenar...~
@2197 = ~I like it.~
@2198 = ~You know, I have a feeling that whatever you ask for would be covered in blood of your enemies within seconds anyway. So perhaps this macabre design is strangely appropriate.~
@2199 = ~Not that I'm changing my mind about the statues.~
@2200 = ~Oh, I agree. Another night in these premises, and I will understand why Cyric is now only partly lucid. Anyone would go mad among whispers and demonic mazes.~
@2201 = ~Oh, no. Don't look at me. You were given the whole deal, high-reliefs and all, so you're stuck with the little imp, I fear.~
@2202 = ~It is going to be our home for a while. It doesn't make me comfortable, no, but the very word: home. A place to stay, for many months.~
@2203 = ~I might... learn to like it. With you. A green sky, a stone floor, demonic voices for guardians - these become mere background noise when I look at your smile. When we talk, laugh, or compare notes about our latest misadventure.~
@2204 = ~I am not saying I would like to stay here forever. But... for now, it is our home, and we'll make the best of it.~
@2205 = ~So we will! Come, Sir Doom, I'll show you the dining room. See two Glabrezu with a fork?~
@2206 = ~Mmm. Definitely not a place to start a family.~
@2207 = ~We are here to stay, whatever that means.~
@2208 = ~I just wish there was a decorator included with a package.~
@2209 = ~Well. Good to see your fine mood isn't ruined. Although, Corellon sees, I tried.~
@2210 = ~Unless you want that stone Balor over there to be your midwife, no.~
@2211 = ~Maybe someone ate him. I saw a bunch of old bones near the portal.~
@2212 = ~Our home. Although I would by far prefer a house. Or a cabin, perhaps. With a rickety table, a rug on the floor, a fire, a river running past... ~
@2213 = ~Perhaps some day?~
@2214 = ~They say that even Cyric is capable of love. Do you believe that?~ [O#XAN285]
@2215 = ~You mean, will I be capable of love, if I become a goddess?~
@2216 = ~Sure. He is capable of hate, isn't he?~
@2217 = ~He is a god. It is different than with us mortals.~
@2218 = ~Nah. All men are pigs.~
@2219 = ~The thing is, I do not know. What if he isn't? His religion is mostly hate, and he himself was rather full of it, I hear, but now? Does he even remember the feeling?~
@2220 = ~(Xan snorts with sudden laughter.)~
@2221 = ~Excluding, by definition, elves and gods, meaning me and Cyric. Well done, <CHARNAME>.~
@2222 = ~I care little for Cyric, as you imagine. I think of the divine in you, and what changes if you take it out.~
@2223 = ~Or, more often than not, I dwell on what happens if... if you take the mortal out. Will you remember to laugh? To care? To remember me?~
@2224 = ~Yet gods are capable of jealousy, strife, revenge and mercy. And where is mercy, there is love.~
@2225 = ~I will always love you, Xan. Whatever becomes of me.~
@2226 = ~I might remember, but my feelings will be different.~
@2227 = ~Mortals are just ants to gods. Don't lie to yourself, Xan.~
@2228 = ~I am not planning to take Bhaal's place, if you recall.~
@2229 = ~I won't be complete either way, it seems.~
@2230 = ~This is what I am afraid of.~
@2231 = ~I... I have to say it, <CHARNAME>, for it has been gnawing at me. Our love is a part of you, but your divinity is a bigger part. And parting with it... or embracing it... will change you irreversibly, it is foolish to deny that.~
@2232 = ~I am not speaking of physical change that passes if you remain mortal - no, it is hardly visible at all. But a door will close: a door on power and immortality. You will have chosen a finite life, and passed a chance to walk among Tyr and Mystra as an equal.~
@2233 = ~Will you live with it? Will you regret it? Become bitter? Laugh and forget this foolishness? Remember, and regret sometimes, but remain steady in that you made the right choice?~
@2234 = ~I just hope that with me, you will be complete.~
@2235 = ~I will be. There is more to me than being a pawn of Bhaal's prophecy, you know this.~
@2236 = ~I may not be. Time will tell.~
@2237 = ~You're doubting yourself? Our bond?~
@2238 = ~What are you saying? That I am not allowed regrets once I choose?~
@2239 = ~And if I become a goddess - will I regret not staying with you? Become bitter without your embrace?~
@2240 = ~(Xan smiles at you.) "Yes" and "no" would be equally full of conceit, no?~
@2241 = ~No! Seldarine, I did not mean that at all.~
@2242 = ~What I am saying is this: weigh your regrets carefully, melamin. Think on them, while you can.~
@2243 = ~Which is why we are talking now, hard though it is.~
@2244 = ~I know. And I love your confidence. But if you are having doubts in the dark - I am with you.~
@2245 = ~Once the final choice is made, there is no going back. And... I am lost. I want you to choose what is best for you, but with all my heart, I do not wish to lose us.~
@2246 = ~The only thing I do know truly is this: if you wish divinity, and your need is bright and burning, there is nothing in the mortal world to replace it.~
@2247 = ~Hence, my question is: are you sure that you will be complete as simply you, <CHARNAME> of Candlekeep? Or even <CHARNAME> of Evereska?~
@2248 = ~And if not - are you certain that divinity is something that burns in your blood, a call you must not exist without, a wondrous way of the Planes you cannot refuse?~
@2249 = ~What would you do, in my shoes?~
@2250 = ~Good points all. I wish I knew.~
@2251 = ~You don't hold out on hard questions, do you?~
@2252 = ~I know what I want. If I have my way, Bhaal's legacy will be mine.~
@2253 = ~I am an elf, like you. I always will be.~
@2254 = ~I try to put myself in your shoes, <CHARNAME>. And fail spectacularly, of course. Despite our bond, I have no notion of how you think - perhaps because I never wanted to be a god.~
@2255 = ~I was made to serve - a Greycloak, a defender of Evereska, like my father before me. I gave my sword arm to Corellon - and you. I do not want command - it isn't right for me. Never was.~
@2256 = ~But if the time of Alaundo is coming to an end, perhaps it is time for me to change, too. Become your disciple, advisor, leader of armies... or just Xan, formerly of Evereska, there with his <CHARNAME>.~
@2257 = ~Perhaps. Perhaps, when time will come, we both will change.~
@2258 = ~Just... be sure.~
@2259 = ~And you are sure? Than you are happier than me in that, at least.~
@2260 = ~Saradush. Finally, some real destruction. Honestly, I'm surprised it took them so long.~ [O#XAN286]
@2261 = ~Them? My siblings?~
@2262 = ~You mean the Five?~
@2263 = ~Well, Sarevok got pretty far along with his war plans...~
@2264 = ~Your brother was malicious enough. Thanks to you, he only got to scheming and assassinations. But while you were fighting him in the North, these Five roamed unchecked - and now you can listen to their cannonade when you walk the city's streets.~
@2265 = ~(sigh) Sarevok... And you gave him a new life. To wreak destruction not dissimilar to Yaga-Shura's catapults, I'll wager. But enough of him; I wanted to talk of another.~
@2266 = ~Sarevok wanted a war of sacrifice to prove his worth. These Five are more utilitarian, I understand: they have rounded up most of the Bhaalspawn in Saradush and slaughter them methodically.~
@2267 = ~I may despise their methods, but truly, they are but instruments of Alaundo's prophecy: the remaining Bhaalspawn MUST die before the Throne is settled, and that is that.~
@2268 = ~But what if there is another way? You have the ear of a powerful Solar. Can't she interfere? She gave you the pocket plane. Why you, and not another? Say, a leader of Saradush refugees, able to lead a thousand Bhaalspawn to safety?~
@2269 = ~Because then the Five wouldn't be able to complete their utilitarian mission.~
@2270 = ~Solar will not help. She is neutral.~
@2271 = ~Because I am the only one capable of killing the Five in the end.~
@2272 = ~Precisely. She wants you to act according to the plan: stumble around blindly, so that when you finally find and destroy the Five, the rest of the Bhaalspawn will already lie dead.~
@2273 = ~This Solar... To see the slaughter, to be so powerful and not help - this is not neutrality, <CHARNAME>. This is silently agreeing with murderers. Conspiracy, if you will.~
@2274 = ~It is... as if you saw a dying man on the road and had a bag full of healing potions, and did not help. Does it make you his murderer? No. Will you feel as bad as one? Probably, yes, and deservedly so.~
@2275 = ~Solar is involved. How deeply I cannot say, but I feel she is an unworthy ally. Not in league with the Five, but... do not take her advice, <CHARNAME>. Do not rely on her. Remember men and women from Saradush, and the catapults that ran from dawn till dusk with Solar's knowledge.~
@2276 = ~I will, Xan. Although she is my only source of information these days, besides Melissan.~
@2277 = ~She simply cannot help, Xan. Understand that.~
@2278 = ~If she helps, Cyric, too, will interfere. And what then?~
@2279 = ~This sounds personal. Did someone wrong you by not helping you in peril?~
@2280 = ~And all her advice comes just a tiny bit late, doesn't it?~
@2281 = ~I... wronged myself, I think. Once. A very long time ago.~
@2282 = ~You are a mortal woman. An elf. And yet you brave deathly peril to come. And Solar cannot? I am not wise, <CHARNAME>, but I think I need a better set of lies.~
@2283 = ~I'd say "a slaughter on a higher level", but I am not sure how it is possible. Still, if Solar views us as chess pieces, does it make her position any better? Or any different from Cyric's?~
@2284 = ~These deeds... this "not-helping"... it taints the soul. When you do it once, twice, many times, your heart hardens. Solar lived for many centuries, and saw much. Is she even capable of good deeds now? If good sits in indecision, what powers rule the Planes?~
@2285 = ~(sigh) As usual, there is a story of my own that goes with it. When I was a young mage, I patrolled the High Forest with a fellow Greycloak; we were both carefree and foolish, and ran into a band of orcs.~
@2286 = ~Both wounded, we crawled into the hills to spend the night - or die; our backpacks gone, we only had one healing potion. We... I do not like to speak of it, <CHARNAME>.~
@2287 = ~Why? What happened?~
@2288 = ~Then don't, if it hurts you.~
@2289 = ~Did you drink the potion?~
@2290 = ~Did he die?~
@2291 = ~But I must, if I want to get my point across.~
@2292 = ~We split the bottle: he died. I lived. I do not remember how severely wounded I was: not too badly, it seems now. But to this day, I wonder what would've happened if I gave him the entire potion.~
@2293 = ~I am by no means a good man. If there is some in me, it rather means that evil is a road I am glad to ignore. But that deed of mine... it was my indecision that killed him. An inability to sacrifice even a little.~
@2294 = ~When it comes to Solars and gods and their indecision, thousands die. Do not put our fate in her hands, melamin.~
@2295 = ~It was not your fault, Xan. You could've both died.~
@2296 = ~I am grateful to that elf. He sacrificed half of the potion for you, and you lived.~
@2297 = ~It's really a no-brainer. Drink the potion yourself, use Solar while she's useful, and DON'T take so much of my time with half-assed weepy stories.~
@2298 = ~I will think on your words.~
@2299 = ~This... is a happier outlook than I've ever thought of.~
@2300 = ~Thank you, Estel'amin.~
@2301 = ~Maybe I should have risked it, don't you think? (sigh) But I thank you for the comfort.~
@2302 = ~It was a long time ago... but it's the kind of wound that hurts regardless of the weather.~
@2303 = ~(Xan suddenly laughs.) Oh, <CHARNAME>... there is evil and there is a pure, lovely, selfish but so very fragile child that lives in you and cares. I love you, but I especially love you for that.~
@2304 = ~And thank you for listening to me. I've indeed taken too much of your time recently; the others probably need you. (sigh) Solar, Melissan... And the Five.~
@2305 = ~<CHARNAME>, would you like some ice cream?~ [O#XAN287]
@2306 = ~(suspiciously) Ice cream?~
@2307 = ~I would, actually.~
@2308 = ~ICE CREAM? Where-where-where-where - GIMME NOW!!!~
@2309 = ~(Jump at Xan without warning, trying to find and grab it)~
@2310 = ~No, thank you.~
@2311 = ~It is rather hot, and you, I dare say, need something to soothe your spirit. And it's tasty. So... would you like some?~
@2312 = ~Sure thing! Hand it over.~
@2313 = ~Please.~
@2314 = ~I'd rather not.~
@2315 = ~Here. With Calimshan sands breathing in our faces, you need something cool and sweet. I've got some caramel in my pockets, too...~
@2316 = ~Can you heat it up?~
@2317 = ~Mmm, I'd rather you had powdered black chocolate...~
@2318 = ~Where did you get all this?!~
@2319 = ~No, I like it as it is.~
@2320 = ~Never mind. Just hand me a spoon.~
@2321 = ~Am I a wizard or aren't I?~
@2322 = ~Only sterling silver for you, my lady.~
@2323 = ~Here you go. Don't eat it all up in one... ah, too late, I see.~
@2324 = ~Well, do tell me if you want more. I have a small secret stash in your old Bag of Holding. And, no, I am not telling you the password.~
@2325 = ~Of course. I do have some figs, if you're interested.~
@2326 = ~WHERE?~
@2327 = ~Mmm! Why didn't you say so?~
@2328 = ~Not hungry, but thanks.~
@2329 = ~(Xan nearly stumbles from your enthusiasm, but deftly catches you in his arms.)~
@2330 = ~You know, I'm not sure that ice cream likes that. Although I appreciate the enthusiasm...~
@2331 = ~Less talk, more ice cream!~
@2332 = ~Xan, I'm close to doing a full body search here...~
@2333 = ~GIMME!!!~
@2334 = ~Here. Still fresh. Mind the skin, it stings a little.~
@2335 = ~I want these moments of levity. You look so young just now, without doom and gloom and... what was it that you said once? Large pink bubbles?~
@2336 = ~I didn't say that! Although it sounds like me, true.~
@2337 = ~Ooooh! Did it come from a dream? Do you dream of me among large pink bubbles, hmm?~
@2338 = ~(laugh) I like that.~
@2339 = ~These moments are precious to me, too.~
@2340 = ~If things go wrong - and they will, trust me - just remember that there is always one more bowl of ice cream. Or another delicacy hidden somewhere, just for you.~
@2341 = ~It won't avert the doom, but it will make you smile. And isn't it all we need, these days?~
@2342 = ~Point well taken. So, another bowl?~
@2343 = ~Absolutely. And a couple of Horrid Wiltings for good measure.~
@2344 = ~All we need is love! Sing it!~
@2345 = ~Xan? We're not doomed.~
@2346 = ~Oh? And what if I do?~
@2347 = ~You don't have to *dream* of it, you know.~
@2348 = ~We could think of something...~
@2349 = ~I just wanted to know, that's all.~
@2350 = ~I'm looking forward to see what you come up with. Although... since I came up with ice cream, I might shoulder this task as well, don't you think?~
@2351 = ~(sigh)~
@2352 = ~Did *anyone* ever tell you that you're insufferable?~
@2353 = ~There was a girl in the Temple District of Athkatla. An adventurer's daughter. Do you remember her?~ [O#XAN288]
@2354 = ~Of course. Taira. I'm glad we helped her.~
@2355 = ~Can't say that I do.~
@2356 = ~Vaguely. I didn't much like her approaching you.~
@2357 = ~I do. What of it?~
@2358 = ~She said she was going to Saradush with her father. I was half-fearing to see her among the refugees.~
@2359 = ~Thankfully, they must've taken a safer way.~
@2360 = ~It's ironic, isn't it? Thousands of people are dying around us, and I'm worrying about an elven girl and her father.~
@2361 = ~Yes, and why?~
@2362 = ~They were elves, like us, and found the same idol we did, back on the Sword Coast.~
@2363 = ~I don't think we'll meet them again.~
@2364 = ~We helped them. They're kind of our responsibility now.~
@2365 = ~'Responsibility' is a strong word. But perhaps you are correct.~
@2366 = ~It is unlikely, yes. Perhaps you are correct.~
@2367 = ~Perhaps I remember them so vividly because Taira and her father were unusual: few adventurers travel with families. Jaheira and Khalid were about the only exception.~
@2368 = ~Most are lonely. Like you, Imoen, Minsc, Edwin, Valygar... me.~
@2369 = ~Or would you say we're a family now? Not just you and me; I mean our entire little party of misfits. Are we? A family of sorts? Or something more, even?~
@2370 = ~We are, aren't we? A proper little crazy family.~
@2371 = ~I think we are much better than a traditional family.~
@2372 = ~Friends and comrades-in-arms, perhaps. But not a family.~
@2373 = ~Nah. Can't wait to get rid of them.~
@2374 = ~A family is much more than an adventuring party.~
@2375 = ~So we are. I am glad you think so.~
@2376 = ~Perhaps we mean the same thing, but use different words?~
@2377 = ~(Xan tries hard, but can't help a snort of suppressed laughter.) <CHARNAME>!~
@2378 = ~Is it, though? Family members do not risk their lives daily for your sake. And you saved ours dozens of times.~
@2379 = ~What I am going to ask is this: when it is over, if nobody is willing to part ways at once... perhaps we all may stay together for a while? Travel with our closest friends and companions?~
@2380 = ~I'd like that, at least for a few months. Later we all may have other plans.~
@2381 = ~I don't know. What about children, if we choose to have any?~
@2382 = ~I would rather spend some time with you, just you and me.~
@2383 = ~I may ascend and abandon you all, remember.~
@2384 = ~Me? What about you?~
@2385 = ~Actually, it's just us for the moment.~
@2386 = ~Not for long, if I am any judge. The guardians in your pocket plane are still active, after all. Just say a word.~
@2387 = ~And much depends on having this 'later'. But I would like us all to remain as we are, even if for a little while.~
@2388 = ~Now that I think of little Taira again, I do not think she had it so bad. Her father was negligent once, true, but they received a good lesson, and both were wiser in the end.~
@2389 = ~Perhaps it is not the worst way to grow up, after all? What child does not dream of adventuring throughout their very youth?~
@2390 = ~(sigh) But I am likely saying something foolish here. Battling a dragon in the woods with a baby on one's hip does not sound very reasonable, does it?~
@2391 = ~Then you'll have it. We'll say our goodbyes, perhaps gather a feast, and start a new chapter in our lives - together. ~
@2392 = ~(sigh) I understand. And it does not bode well for me on too many counts. Before meeting you, I have been alone for so long. I... I would not want to be on my own again.~
@2393 = ~Me? Strangely, I'd rather stay together. I've grown attached to our merry bend, unusual though it is.~
@2394 = ~But these are just idle musings. I was wondering if it is possible - to merge family and comradeship, preserve this little world that we have, the few of us, and call it home for a little while after the deed is done. Not for decades, clearly... but for a year or two?~
@2395 = ~And you listened. Thank you for this, melamin.~
@2396 = ~Back in Nashkel mines my moonblade was legendary. Now it is little more than an enchanted dagger.~ [O#XAN289]
@2397 = ~It is much more than that.~
@2398 = ~We are walking among myths, Xan. Your blade is but one of them.~
@2399 = ~Ha! In this case, I'd like a copy of that dagger, if you please.~
@2400 = ~Indeed. These days, we find items of legend whenever we go.~
@2401 = ~I may feel a little miffed about that, to be honest. To be less special than I used to be... do you know the feeling?~
@2402 = ~Perhaps you do. Back in Baldur's Gate, you were The Bhaalspawn: only Sarevok's heritage was revealed. But Imoen came, and the Five followed, and then Saradush - an entire city of your siblings.~
@2403 = ~Even your companions, while not divine in essence, are nearly so in power. It must be annoying at times, surely.~
@2404 = ~It is! Maybe when I am a goddess, it will finally be over.~
@2405 = ~Sometimes. But I learn to live with it.~
@2406 = ~In truth, it makes me feel normal.~
@2407 = ~Not at all. I am happy to blend into background.~
@2408 = ~I don't know. I never thought of it this way.~
@2409 = ~Only if you destroy Cyric, Tyr, Sune, Oghma and an array of deities with them, I fear. And they won't go quietly.~
@2410 = ~That so? Perhaps you are right, but with this adventure over, you'll be the mightiest of the strong, not 'normal'. You'll never fade into background, <CHARNAME>.~
@2411 = ~Yet, without even noticing it, we grew. My magic is nearly legendary. Even my adventuring garb costs a small fortune.~
@2412 = ~But a part of me misses the times when I was the ever-so-special moonblade wielder, and you - a mysterious lady of unknown heritage.~
@2413 = ~(laugh) Why, Xan! I didn't know you were so vain!~
@2414 = ~I miss those times, too.~
@2415 = ~Nah. I prefer power.~
@2416 = ~It is just a bout of nostalgia, Xan. Everyone has it from time to times.~
@2417 = ~(sigh) I should have known. Of course. But if you want real power, don't you want to be unique?~
@2418 = ~You think it's nostalgia? Grass was greener and all that? Yes, most likely. And yet...~
@2419 = ~It's... not vanity. Well, not exactly vanity. (sigh) Not just vanity, in any case.~
@2420 = ~With Alaundo's prophecy in effect, everything around us is absurdly multiplied. A simple soldier wears a magical armor, Bhaal's children become invulnerable giants, our regular foes are elementals, demons and armies of drow.~
@2421 = ~This way of life leaves me feeling ill at ease sometimes. Imagine it is over, and we are back in - I do not know - Evereska, quiet halls of Candlekeep or the streets of Baldur's Gate. Will we be able to go back to simple life? To be as we were?~
@2422 = ~No one can ever go back. Perhaps that's why heroes like Drizzt are ever wandering, too notable for settling down and too powerful to be left alone.~
@2423 = ~Ever wandering and killing dragons? Doesn't sound too bad to me.~
@2424 = ~I still have hope for a simple life, even after all this.~
@2425 = ~What if I build an empire? Guards in magic armor, foes like dragons in the deep caves of my provinces, being powerful and notable - it all fits. No wandering required.~
@2426 = ~Honestly, I'm surprised at you. You're supposed to say: "It is hopeless", not plan our future.~
@2427 = ~You assume that adventures and rewards keep multiplying, but the mortal world has limits. It has to stop sometime. And after a hundredth dragon and the thousandth hoard, won't you simply feel empty?~
@2428 = ~Then you are far more optimistic than I am.~
@2429 = ~(He smiles.) Strangely, it fills me with hope.~
@2430 = ~True, if not my first choice. (sigh) And not my hundredth, either.~
@2431 = ~Worry not, I was just about to point it out. Although... wait. I was about to mention the opposite. You are the worst of influences, <CHARNAME>.~
@2432 = ~(sigh) I am far too morose, perhaps. There are bright moments, and always have been.~
@2433 = ~For one, you are rich: you can probably buy land and a house, if you wanted. Or travel the world aboard your own ship. Converse with the mightiest heroes and monarchs. Help out in the darkest hours, rewrite pages of history...~
@2434 = ~It's not so bad, is it? If you forget endless battles, enemies, watching and plotting.~
@2435 = ~Which might just lead to our inevitable doom. Which, in turn, returns us to my first point: it was far less dangerous when my moonblade was about the only magical weapon around, your divine abilities never stretched beyond a simple healing spell, and our mightiest enemy was a half-ogre.~
@2436 = ~(sigh) I do miss those times.~
@2437 = ~You are daydreaming again. What about, I wonder?~ [O#XAN290]
@2438 = ~About you, of course.~
@2439 = ~Me, me and myself.~
@2440 = ~Not sure. Something.~
@2441 = ~Just planning our next steps.~
@2442 = ~Me? No, not daydreaming.~
@2443 = ~Not telling.~
@2444 = ~Daydreaming? Xan, I fight and I loot. I leave poetry to you.~
@2445 = ~(Xan laughs a little.) Indeed. How could I have been so sorely mistaken?~
@2446 = ~A beautiful subject.~
@2447 = ~Oh? Is it something I want to hear about? Tonight, for instance?~
@2448 = ~Ever a practical one. All right, then.~
@2449 = ~Now I am intrigued. But I'll leave your private thoughts be.~
@2450 = ~I haven't been much of a dreamer until meeting you. Not in my Greycloak days: too many deaths, long journeys, cold, ingratitude and tired feet. But as days pass, I find myself lapsing more and more often. Do you want to hear about it?~
@2451 = ~Of course. Do you have a dream?~
@2452 = ~What is it about?~
@2453 = ~I do.~
@2454 = ~Go on. As long as it's not about our doom, mind.~
@2455 = ~If it has me in it, certainly.~
@2456 = ~No, I don't.~
@2457 = ~It does.~
@2458 = ~As you say. To the road, then.~
@2459 = ~Of course not. That would fall into a category of 'dreading', not 'dreaming'.~
@2460 = ~I have a dream: to live with you in a villa by the water, lie in bed, listen to the birds singing, taste freshly baked bread and honey in the morning, bring it to you as you open your eyes...~
@2461 = ~And yet I wish for an evening to come when we take our cloaks, shut the door behind us without a sound and step on the road. And then... a journey would begin.~
@2462 = ~I cannot imagine what sort of journey, where to, why and how. But there is freedom in dreaming. And incredible freedom in stepping out of your home and going anywhere - but remembering that you have a home. A lit lantern in the night, and a memory to keep us warm.~
@2463 = ~For I will have neither the home nor the journey without you. Will you?~
@2464 = ~No, I won't. I love your dream, Xan.~
@2465 = ~My ideal home would be different. Would you trade yours for mine?~
@2466 = ~Now I'm intrigued! I want to go on a journey!~
@2467 = ~It's a lovely dream. I am glad you shared it.~
@2468 = ~Maybe, maybe not. But we'll stay together.~
@2469 = ~Oh, Xan... you are a dreamer.~
@2470 = ~No. I dream of a totally different future.~
@2471 = ~And I cannot dream it for you. I know. But perhaps, as we walk, you will tell me of it?~
@2472 = ~And we will, some day.~
@2473 = ~As long as I get to bring you breakfast sometimes. To a sunlit terrace, perhaps?~
@2474 = ~There are millions of futures. And hundreds of homes. Among the starlight, in the highest trees, by the sea, in bustling cities and imposing castles - depending on one's mood and the seasons. I noticed that dreams often shift to adventure in springtime, and to home in the autumn.~
@2475 = ~I hope we'll live many seasons together, melamin. May all our best dreams come to fruition... hand in hand with a long, long life.~
@2476 = ~Or is it yet another dream?~
@2477 = ~You know what? I am happy.~ [O#XAN291]
@2478 = ~Come again?~
@2479 = ~Awww.~
@2480 = ~Nah. Impossible.~
@2481 = ~Sounds good. But... unusual.~
@2482 = ~Wait. Who are you and where is my Xan?~
@2483 = ~Why?~
@2484 = ~I know, I know. But bear with me.~
@2485 = ~Today I woke up with a tingle in my sword arm. It fell asleep and hurt for a moment, and I suddenly remembered how it ached after Bodhi's ambush in the graveyard, when you took in my pain to save me.~
@2486 = ~But here I am. And here you are.~
@2487 = ~I am alive, Estel'amin. Still and yet - alive. Here to hold you, sigh about the weather and keep you company. And I am able to look at you - daily and in reverie. It is wonderful.~
@2488 = ~I don't want to think what would've happened otherwise.~
@2489 = ~It is. I am happy to be here with you.~
@2490 = ~Is it? Despite Our Mighty Foes and Our Inevitable Doom?~
@2491 = ~Compared to the forests of Arvandor, our surroundings do seem a little bleak, but the very thought of dying there, in the graveyard, and leaving you alone... No. Seldarine, I'm happy to be in the Abyss, if it is where you will go.~
@2492 = ~Very deep down, of course. And you would never get the words from me however you tried.~
@2493 = ~But... yes. I am happy here with you.~
@2494 = ~Yay!~
@2495 = ~Sugar overdose, dear. We're all DOOMED, don't you forget that.~
@2496 = ~I'd be happy, too, if only I got enough sleep with all the ambushes.~
@2497 = ~Absolutely. And if I could get a bowl of mango, I'd be even happier.~
@2498 = ~Happy enough to give me a massage?~
@2499 = ~(Hug Xan and never let go)~
@2500 = ~Come, then, melamin. I'd hate for us to miss the last act of our long, dreary, and yet fantastic play.~
@2501 = ~Listening and obeying, my enchanting mistress.~
@2502 = ~We can reverie together again, if you want. Or, given our current might, you may simply continue sleeping. I will probably drive our enemies away with a well-placed Death spell or two, anyway.~
@2503 = ~Perhaps I could help with that...~
@2504 = ~(Xan at once steps up to you, and you stand embraced for a long, long time.)~
@2505 = ~Have you thought about what we talked about before? Of the final choice between mortality and dreams, divinity and regrets?~ [O#XAN292]
@2506 = ~Not really. I was busy with other things.~
@2507 = ~Yes, of course.~
@2508 = ~Truthfully, I think of little else.~
@2509 = ~I have. More than enough, actually.~
@2510 = ~Can we talk of nothing else?~
@2511 = ~I am tired of this topic. Let's do something fun!~
@2512 = ~I understand. Which is why I actually have a different idea.~
@2513 = ~Ah, <CHARNAME>, you are reading my mind again.~
@2514 = ~We've discussed it over and over. So it is time to put that old tired creature to rest, I say. How about we play a game?~
@2515 = ~Pretend that this ordeal with Bhaal's legacy is over, and you are free. Whether you are still mortal or not is for you to decide: we are playing a game, remember.~
@2516 = ~In the end, perhaps, it will influence nothing. But it is nice to dream, is it not?~
@2517 = ~So, close your eyes, melamin. What do you see? Where are you?~
@2518 = ~I... ~
@2519 = ~I don't really want to, Xan.~
@2520 = ~Not even a little?~
@2521 = ~Well, I suppose I could try it.~
@2522 = ~Not my thing. Sorry.~
@2523 = ~Not even a little.~
@2524 = ~All right. Well... I am out of other ideas, I fear. Shall we simply walk hand in hand for a while?~
@2525 = ~Yes?~
@2526 = ~First, you must know that I am still me, <CHARNAME>, an elven girl from Candlekeep...~
@2527 = ~Lightning, thunder and blackness surround me. I am the Lady of Murder, and no one will cross my path and live.~
@2528 = ~I am an impossibly beautiful(and evil!) goddess, floating about my realm...~
@2529 = ~An image of perfection, my new plane reflects Elysium and Arvandor in equal measure... and I am just as perfect.~
@2530 = ~As a force of balance and good, I bring peace and justice to the Planes...~
@2531 = ~Perfection itself, I see. Do you ever get lonely, I wonder?~
@2532 = ~Evil and darkness... Is that all divinity is for you, I wonder?~
@2533 = ~But it means power, and new wisdom, and so much more. You will never be safe, but you will do great things.~
@2534 = ~Seems like a good start.~
@2535 = ~I am sitting by the river among low-leaning tree branches, fallen leaves under my feet...~
@2536 = ~I am looking at the night sky from a hilltop, counting the stars. The grass cools my feet and hands, while I bathe my face in the starlight...~
@2537 = ~A house made of wood and stone, flowers are in bloom, and a fountain sparkles in midday sun...~
@2538 = ~An elven home, ancient and welcoming, a villa on the outskirts of Evereska, by a waterfall, quiet and secure in eternal solitude...~
@2539 = ~A fire burns low, and we exchange stories with other weary travellers, for our road is long and much is left to do. New adventures await us in the morning, but for now, we rest.~
@2540 = ~A dragon roars, but I attack, and my companions assist me. Finally, the beast falls, and I rush to the pile of treasure it leaves behind.~
@2541 = ~I stand at the head of a conquering army, dressed in the finest battle garb. My enemies will be routed, and the greatest throne of the Realms shall be mine!~
@2542 = ~A castle stands in the center of a grand city, and brightly-dressed people pour into the streets for a great celebration. Today I, the new queen, ascend to the throne.~
@2543 = ~There is a well-known tavern at a crossroads, and I am its new proprietor. The songs never cease, the laughter never stops, and the ale never runs out.~
@2544 = ~My shop is exotic and extremely expensive, but it's the best. All adventurers know of it, but only the very best can afford to shop in it.~
@2545 = ~You know me. I will never entirely abandon my craft, so I start teaching what I know, and my apprentices will be known as some of the most powerful ones in the whole history of the Realms.~
@2546 = ~I used to have a lovely stronghold in Amn. With time, this dream of mine will only grow - a home and a destiny both.~
@2547 = ~I am in Sigil, where each door is a promise. With a laugh, I open one of them - and I am gone.~
@2548 = ~I am a planewalker, a former Sensate, a rebel Doomguard - and I have seen it all. From Baator to Carceri, from Arborea to the Abyss - the Multiverse is my oyster.~
@2549 = ~I am helping the elves, like I was born to do. A Champion of Elvendom, as you are.~
@2550 = ~A champion, a defender, a hero. May you be lauded, and lauded fairly.~
@2551 = ~And you are still a dreamer. I love it in you.~
@2552 = ~A house and a home. I dearly hope I will get to see it.~
@2553 = ~Doom, danger and adventuring... (cough) I am sorry, Estel'amin. The word 'doom' will not escape my lips twice, I assure you.~
@2554 = ~A throne. Again. (groan) Ahem. I'm still listening, melamin.~
@2555 = ~And to think that I never pegged you for a people person. But are you sure you won't ever get tired of it?~
@2556 = ~A noble cause. Perhaps I should take an apprentice or two, as well, in my own time?~
@2557 = ~A head-spinning journey you are planning, I see. And if you wish it, I am with you.~
@2558 = ~What of those by your side? Or are you alone?~
@2559 = ~Well, there is a slight figure in purple robes... a sighing enchanter of no small caliber. And his trademark words are...~
@2560 = ~I am, but never for long. We may be apart sometimes, Xan, but I intend to stay by your side.~
@2561 = ~My closest friends are around me. We adventure together, help each other, and sometimes just visit for tea.~
@2562 = ~I don't know if you noticed it... but there is a child in my arms.~
@2563 = ~I see family. Children. Perhaps even grandchildren, although I can't fathom it yet. And some of them look just like you!~
@2564 = ~Oh. There is a man with me... tall, handsome... so gorgeous... and it's - not you. Sorry.~
@2565 = ~There are some people - a new friend or two, an old companion, a sibling, perhaps. And, of course, there's you.~
@2566 = ~Oh, so many people! Friends, enemies, friends of enemies, enemies of friends - I never tire of it!~
@2567 = ~Yes. I am alone. I am not unhappy about it, though.~
@2568 = ~(sigh) You know, don't you?~
@2569 = ~And glad I am to hear that.~
@2570 = ~A lovely picture. I see it... and I want to be in it.~
@2571 = ~(He smiles.) Incredible. It does seem a happy future, come to think of it. If... you are happy.~
@2572 = ~And suddenly I'm not liking this game anymore.~
@2573 = ~And you surprise me once more. But of course, with your bright spirit - can it be anything else? A bird is born to fly.~
@2574 = ~Then know that you may call for my company whenever you wish it.~
@2575 = ~There are many futures for you - those you mentioned and so many more. Yet one matters to me the most - where we walk into the sunrise together.~
@2576 = ~Or the sunset: I am told the night brings many wonders.~
@2577 = ~<CHARNAME>... let us be together tonight. For it is no game for you and I, and I want you near me. With me. And to take your hand when the sun rises.~
@2578 = ~Of course, melamin.~
@2579 = ~Why not right now?~
@2580 = ~Naughty! I like that.~
@2581 = ~Hmm. I'll have to think about it.~
@2582 = ~Maybe not, but here is my hand.~
@2583 = ~(You join in a kiss.)~
@2584 = ~A brilliant idea. Will you... call... for a rest?~
@2585 = ~Until then?~
@2586 = ~And she loves tormenting me, too, it seems. ~
@2587 = ~And never has it been accepted more gratefully.~
@2588 = ~Well. I wanted to talk to you, but it seems I've run out of things to say. Does this even happen anymore?~ [O#XAN293]
@2589 = ~You bet. Otherwise we'd be talking endlessly, and who would be slaying my siblings then?~
@2590 = ~Alas. We are doomed.~
@2591 = ~You, running out of things to say? Impossible!~
@2592 = ~Well, we can't have that. Tell you what: start with "All is lost", and go on from there.~
@2593 = ~No idea. But I'm glad we are getting a chance to talk.~
@2594 = ~You jest, as always, but I was serious... I think. Or was I?~
@2595 = ~Oh, I'm sure they'd perfect the act of self-immolating, just to accommodate Alaundo's ramblings. Or someone else would take our place. You know what they say: there is *always* another Bhaalspawn.~
@2596 = ~And I. I enjoy simple things with you so much... it is incredible.~
@2597 = ~Getting sentimental in your old age?~
@2598 = ~I know the feeling.~
@2599 = ~And you say we've run out of things to say!~
@2600 = ~Yet it is true. We travelled the Realms, made love, friends and enemies, acquired mounds of treasure and are well on the way to challenge Bhaal's legacy - and there is nearly nothing left to say. Well, apart from the obvious things.~
@2601 = ~That I love you and you love me?~
@2602 = ~That we're all doomed!~
@2603 = ~Which reminds me. Someone ate all the cheese again.~
@2604 = ~I know, Xan. It gets to me, too, sometimes.~
@2605 = ~There is a sense of finality in your words. Of an ending.~
@2606 = ~Well, there is that.~
@2607 = ~An ending. Too soon, doesn't it? It always seems too soon.~
@2608 = ~But it is not an ending. It is a new start for those of us tired of dungeon crawling, a next grand adventure for those who want to go on, a chance for closure... to do something else with our lives. We are not going to wander aimlessly forever, are we?~
@2609 = ~It is still too soon.~
@2610 = ~True enough. Still, it makes me sad for some reason.~
@2611 = ~As long as we are wandering together, I'm fine with any amount of aimlessness.~
@2612 = ~I am looking forward to it. I have so many plans for our future, you can't imagine!~
@2613 = ~It may mean we'll never see each other again. If I do as Solar hints and take Bhaal's place...~
@2614 = ~My sentiments exactly. Strange how life twists and turns and never tells us how good we have it until it is about to end, isn't it? But perhaps it is as it should be.~
@2615 = ~And with an absence of hot water, soft beds, fresh fruit and good healers? Because, prosaic as it may seem, we have little of those in these parts.~
@2616 = ~Hopefully, your plans don't include yet *another* perilous adventure with dragons and demiliches. (sigh) Not for an hour or so, at least.~
@2617 = ~I know. Is it what you want?~
@2618 = ~Yes.~
@2619 = ~I don't know. It may be.~
@2620 = ~No... not without you.~
@2621 = ~I think not.~
@2622 = ~(Xan sighs.)~
@2623 = ~We will talk again when the end of this adventure is upon us. Of little things. Of simple things. Or - of the Fates, doom, great love, sacrifices and sorrow.~
@2624 = ~But now, I think, is the time for me to fall silent. Until the Throne of Bhaal claims us.~
@2625 = ~So, the Prince of Lies. Did you enjoy your conversation?~ [O#XAN294]
@2626 = ~(blush) He is very... accomplished. In certain matters.~
@2627 = ~Ooooh, you have no idea!~
@2628 = ~Very much, thank you.~
@2629 = ~Too bad I couldn't recruit him into my party.~
@2630 = ~It was all right, I suppose.~
@2631 = ~He was boring. And full of himself.~
@2632 = ~(drily) Imagine that.~
@2633 = ~That'd be something to see, I imagine. Or not. Considering *all* his titles, I'm in favor of 'not'.~
@2634 = ~You met an avatar of a living god. This is the first for me. Well, there was Rillifane, but we didn't really have much of a conversation besides "The Exile returns".~
@2635 = ~And in Cyric's words, I am one of your so-called friends, am I? Seldarine, I felt like a scolded child for the first time in... centuries, I believe. (sigh)~
@2636 = ~Yet, he came and addressed you specifically, so I'm rather unconcerned whether he was rude to me or invited you for tea. By the way, did he?~
@2637 = ~Jealous, are we?~
@2638 = ~Hmm. He did say he resided in Pandemonium, "much better than anywhere in the Abyss"... ~
@2639 = ~I could go and visit him, I suppose...~
@2640 = ~Offered me an alliance, you mean? It was more of a "we'll see" kind of moment.~
@2641 = ~His exact words were: "gauge your threat".~
@2642 = ~Surprisingly logical from a god of madness... if he still is one, of course.~
@2643 = ~And if I indeed was uneasy about your sudden... alliance?~
@2644 = ~What? It's perfectly innocent! Just tea... or an early morning cup of coffee. (wink)~
@2645 = ~I planned my costume, too. Small bronze circles on my breasts, a long transparent skirt, or a veil, rather, leaving the leg bare...~
@2646 = ~If I end up accepting Bhaal's legacy, I will need to establish relationships.~
@2647 = ~Cyric is the biggest threat to us. You know this, Xan. ~
@2648 = ~Supernatural charm or no, he is a deity of lies and deceit. You can imagine how long your alliance lasts - and how quickly he will use any information you will give him.~
@2649 = ~And if you are not planning any such thing, it is marginally better: metaphorically speaking, he knows where you live.~
@2650 = ~(sigh) We are doomed. Perhaps I should become a priest of the Black Sun to protect you?~
@2651 = ~I'd rather you became *my* priest.~
@2652 = ~And what will you do when Cyric orders you to assassinate me? Play "a hapless assassin and an enraged victim"?~
@2653 = ~Bad joke, Xan.~
@2654 = ~I suppose my stale old "we're not doomed" doesn't fit here now?~
@2655 = ~Really? To keep battling Cyric's clergy for a pitiful few days, until I am assassinated in your temple? An enviable fate, to be sure.~
@2656 = ~Tempting. But you have a point.~
@2657 = ~I rather liked it, myself. But perhaps it's my fate: laugh at my own irony. (sigh) Ironic, don't you think?~
@2658 = ~Not at all. I like you saying that. It's... like receiving an answer from the universe, of sorts.~
@2659 = ~(Suddenly his breath singes your cheek.)~
@2660 = ~<CHARNAME>... there's teasing and there's teasing. How far do you want it to go?~
@2661 = ~As far as it can.~
@2662 = ~Let's forget this. What were you saying about Cyric?~
@2663 = ~(Xan makes a barely perceptible gesture, and suddenly, unable to move or speak, you nearly topple over.)~
@2664 = ~(Within another second, helpless, you end up in his arms, with him embracing you from behind. Xan's fingers, gliding along your ear and neck, seem almost teasing. He slowly turns you, until you come face to face.)~
@2665 = ~What will you do now, I wonder?~
@2666 = ~(Kiss him)~
@2667 = ~(Will yourself from under the spell and tackle him to the floor)~
@2668 = ~(Unable to move, you arch an eyebrow)~
@2669 = ~(Give him a very cold look)~
@2670 = ~(Your mouth moves reluctantly at first, countering the last vestiges of the spell, but soon its shreds disappear in the passion.)~
@2671 = ~(Barely realizing where he is and where you are, you join in a dark, pleasant fall, where the head spins, your body feels dangerously light and all conscious thoughts melt in the hot, tangled darkness.)~
@2672 = ~(With the last, long and desperate kiss you part for a second, panting.)~
@2673 = ~<CHARNAME>, I'd like nothing more, but not now, here, with everyone watching... ~
@2674 = ~No?~
@2675 = ~Let us... call... a rest. ~
@2676 = ~It's... enough for now, I think.~
@2677 = ~Hmm? Oh, well, if you're sure... because I certainly am not.~
@2678 = ~(He gives you a brief smile.) You'll call for a rest soon, won't you?~
@2679 = ~In such moments, I lose my head entirely. You are closer to me than anyone - Corellon, Greycloaks, my city. I melt into shadows with you... and yet it is such a pleasant feeling, such a *right* one.~
@2680 = ~There's one more thing I wanted to say about this business with Cyric and the gods... will you listen?~
@2681 = ~Of course.~
@2682 = ~What is it?~
@2683 = ~Not now. My head still spins.~
@2684 = ~Of course. And speaking of gods... do be careful.~
@2685 = ~(The spell breaks into icy needles pricking your skin, and before Xan is able to react, he is lying on the floor, as helpless as you were a moment before.)~
@2686 = ~(Passionately kiss him)~
@2687 = ~(Wordlessly help him up)~
@2688 = ~And don't do it again.~
@2689 = ~I lost my self-control, it seems. Although it wasn't a bad thing entirely...~
@2690 = ~It wasn't.~
@2691 = ~No... (You kiss him.)~
@2692 = ~It was.~
@2693 = ~(Very slowly, he leans in to kiss you.)~
@2694 = ~(Answer the kiss)~
@2695 = ~(Shake your head)~
@2696 = ~(The spell releases you at once. Xan sighs.)~
@2697 = ~And I had such plans, too... Forgive me.~
@2698 = ~Forgiven - if you show me your plans. Right now.~
@2699 = ~Hmph. We'll see.~
@2700 = ~Not if you do this again! What if there was another Cyric's assassin behind you?~
@2701 = ~Just do not repeat it.~
@2702 = ~Again, forgive me. I lost my head, as they say. With all this Cyric business...~
@2703 = ~I do know this. It's just... you cannot rely on him.~
@2704 = ~I... wonder if I ever will meet Corellon's avatar like you met Cyric's. For a moment, as I watched you two, it was my greatest desire - to see him, behold the First of the Seldarine, bare my soul before him. Is it what true worship feels like?~
@2705 = ~Perhaps we should rest, <CHARNAME>. Talking to gods is a tiring business.~
@2706 = ~And do be careful.~
@2707 = ~No! Please, do not leave! There is so much...~ [O#XAN295]
@2708 = ~Gone. He is... gone.~
@2709 = ~Who is gone?~
@2710 = ~Bad dream?~
@2711 = ~You scared me, you know.~
@2712 = ~Not a dream. A vision... I think. And not bad, it's just... I have no words.~
@2713 = ~I am sorry, <CHARNAME>. I scared myself, to be honest.~
@2714 = ~I saw Corellon. A vision of my god, so bright I'd shield my eyes, but I could not move. I was bare before him; he saw my spirit to the core, and yet I was not afraid... I should have never been afraid, it seems.~
@2715 = ~He did not talk to me, but I saw... places, and understood things. We have done much, you and me and our merry band. Without you, the Sword Coast would be boiling with blood, and Yaga-Shura's armies would crush Tethyr. Dragons flew over Calimshan, and vampires... no, I will not speak of it.~
@2716 = ~I was never sure we did the right thing in our adventures. I still am not, despite even my god showing me otherwise. But I was endlessly, boundlessly thankful to him for accepting me - and you. And there is more...~
@2717 = ~(Xan gives a long sigh.)~
@2718 = ~He offered to extinguish my blade. After our task is done... "You will be free," I heard.~
@2719 = ~So you won't be trapped in it for a thousand years?~
@2720 = ~And he will release spirits of other guardians, too?~
@2721 = ~Say WHAT?~
@2722 = ~This is good, right?~
@2723 = ~I never dreamt he would release me. All these years, preparing to be trapped in the sword, like my father before me... and suddenly...~
@2724 = ~I am not sure I deserve it.~
@2725 = ~What about your father, the other wielders? Don't they deserve freedom?~
@2726 = ~What about me? Don't you want us to be together in the Blessed Realm?~
@2727 = ~It will be good for you, I think.~
@2728 = ~I hope we'll be together someday. Don't you?~
@2729 = ~This is your duty. Can you just give it up?~
@2730 = ~They... they do, naturally, and much more than me, but I cannot ask them. Would they beg me for release, or chastise me for breaking my oath? Would my father?~
@2731 = ~Melamin... of course. Say the word. But I am allowed doubts, or am I?~
@2732 = ~Perhaps, but what will be left of me?~
@2733 = ~I do not dare hope, to be honest. If you do... this is enough for me. But it is too much to take at once.~
@2734 = ~I am bound to my sword. This is... was?.. my duty, for decades and more. If I give it up, I will cease to be a moonblade wielder, a Defender of Elvendom. All that defines me will be gone.~
@2735 = ~And if I cease being a Bhaalspawn, I will face the same.~
@2736 = ~It is frightening, I agree.~
@2737 = ~But it is time to decide. Corellon won't wait long.~
@2738 = ~I don't see what the problem is. This is what you always wanted.~
@2739 = ~Perhaps we shall change together. Face it hand in hand, as always?~
@2740 = ~Fate is a strange mistress, yet again.~
@2741 = ~<CHARNAME>, our time together draws to a close, you know this. You'll no longer need me, but the elvendom will. I am an archmage: will I shut my ears, get rid of my blade and become willfully blind?~
@2742 = ~War is afoot: there are hunted and desperate elven refugees everywhere. What will they do, if they cry in the night and no one comes?~
@2743 = ~You weren't so big on helping the unfortunate earlier.~
@2744 = ~You can help other elves without the moonblade.~
@2745 = ~It is your decision. I can only wish you well.~
@2746 = ~But what about you? Your spirit will be trapped for centuries after you die.~
@2747 = ~Because I was travelling with you and had time for little else. All decisions were yours, but soon I must go back to choosing mine, whether I want to or not.~
@2748 = ~I can, but will they accept it? A Defender of Elvendom is trusted without question, even if the price is his life. Once I agreed to pay that price. Can I just throw it away?~
@2749 = ~Thank you, my friend. I appreciate it, more than you can imagine.~
@2750 = ~I am not dead yet. This is, I'm afraid, my main gullibility: I cannot accept the fact in its entirety while my heart beats.~
@2751 = ~Besides, nobody awaits me in the afterlife: perhaps it'll be nothing but a long, peaceful sleep? Not so bad, after all.~
@2752 = ~Regardless, I am not free yet. Perhaps I never will be... I certainly won't be free, if we do not survive. There is too much in my mind: it is filled to the brim with light and memory, and is about to burst.~
@2753 = ~Not much left of our journey, either. We both need to prepare; to think. But I am here if you need me.~
@2754 = ~Just... know this: if I am indeed given the chance to part with my moonblade, to become free to live a life with you, and join you when we pass away - I will do so.~
@2755 = ~Perhaps on the night of our victory, perhaps years after. But if I am blessed with the choice, we will be free, melamin, I swear it.~
@2756 = ~Just know this: you have been a fine friend, and it honors me that I have been given a choice because of helping you. Even if I am going to bear my sword for the rest of my life... it needed to be said. Thank you.~
@2757 = ~The last challenge. Is it time for a grand goodbye? Or a quiet farewell?~ [O#XAN296]
@2758 = ~No. Just hold me.~
@2759 = ~No farewells. But you'd better tell me you bought us a house somewhere, because this plane will go boom.~
@2760 = ~Oh, are you going already? Not even staying for a cup of tea?~
@2761 = ~This may be our last chance.~
@2762 = ~If you are buying, certainly. Although with every soldier walking around here in magical boots, a cup of tea must be costing worse than a resurrection. And over the way, I must have cost you a few of these...~
@2763 = ~Those were the times.~
@2764 = ~Aw, it wasn't that bad.~
@2765 = ~No, but your robes cost me an arm and a leg. And don't even get me started on jewelry.~
@2766 = ~And now these times are drawing to a close. Although there will be swords and dragons and cups of tea, it will never be the same, will it?~
@2767 = ~I did, as a matter of fact. Or, rather, you did. It was only an investment, but with house prices on the rise in Baldur's Gate, you made a small fortune over these two years.~
@2768 = ~(Xan wraps you up in his arms, with his chin in your hair, and cool fingers stroking your brow. You stand like this for a few moments, and then he begins to speak quietly.)~
@2769 = ~Remember when you were proclaimed the Hero of Baldur's Gate? We were rich then, and nobody really knew what to do with their newfound wealth. So... I invested some of my share, in your name.~
@2770 = ~East of the Temple of Helm, north of the Ducal Palace, there was a house, then empty, where we founded - or looted - the Helm of Glory. It's a simple two-storey building with little in the way of luxuries. But... it's yours.~
@2771 = ~Thank you, Xan. It's a lovely gift.~
@2772 = ~You're more practical than I gave you credit for.~
@2773 = ~Why didn't you tell me?~
@2774 = ~Really?~
@2775 = ~I am not sure I want to live in Baldur's Gate.~
@2776 = ~I'd like to see the city again. Do you think we'll be welcomed?~
@2777 = ~As real as your voice is right now. Although they might have demolished the building already, who can say? But knowing you, you'll simply take up Duke Belt's quarters.~
@2778 = ~Some will fear you, I do not doubt - but such is the fate of heroes everywhere. Besides, I'm sure Elminster put in a good word or two. After all, what else is he good for?~
@2779 = ~I did this after we parted, on my way home. The deal just came up as I was buying some scrolls in Sorcerous Sundries, and I couldn't very well ask you, as you might imagine. And then... well... I simply forgot.~
@2780 = ~You forgot a house?~
@2781 = ~We had other things to worry about, it's true.~
@2782 = ~All right.~
@2783 = ~What can I say? I was thinking of you.~
@2784 = ~If we go to Evereska one day, which I hope we will, Baldur's Gate can be a good place to stop and get our bearings before the rest of the journey.~
@2785 = ~We could visit Candlekeep, too - they will probably keep you for ages with questions about your adventures, and how the prophecy finally... came to...~
@2786 = ~(Xan suddenly breaks off.)~
@2787 = ~It hasn't come to pass, not yet. But everything will be all right, love. I'm with you.~
@2788 = ~Don't be afraid, Xan. I will not leave.~
@2789 = ~I know how you feel. I don't know what will happen, myself.~
@2790 = ~Only now I know what doom is. To love so fully - and to stand on the precipice of losing it all... to feel each second so keenly...~
@2791 = ~If we mortals love so strongly, how do gods love? They can't forget what they were before, I am sure. Then... is it impossible that we may meet again, after everything is said and done?~
@2792 = ~There are portals between the planes, demigods and Mystra's favored, so who is to say that we won't have a future?~
@2793 = ~Who indeed?~
@2794 = ~The future itself?~
@2795 = ~Plane-crossed lovers? I like the sound of that.~
@2796 = ~Now I am simply *tempted* to take godhood, if offered.~
@2797 = ~Wait just an hour, Xan. Just another hour, and all your fears will just vanish.~
@2798 = ~And here I almost believed that life wasn't hollow.~
@2799 = ~But therein lies darkness, and even divine light won't get it gone: loneliness, and pain of parting, and despair. Say what you will of gods, <CHARNAME>, but they are not all-powerful.~
@2800 = ~(Xan looks at you with a strange smile.) The longest hour of my life. But I do not want it to be over.~
@2801 = ~Melissan be damned, come here, <CHARNAME>. Stay with me. And let it not be the last time I hold you in my arms.~
@2802 = ~Never the last.~
@2803 = ~It may well be the last time, love. I am sorry.~
@2804 = ~Not now. I need to face Melissan first.~
@2805 = ~(Xan steps back, letting you go.)~
@2806 = ~Don't be. We created our world, melamin. And I was proud to live in it.~
@2807 = ~Then we shall. Command me as you will, <CHARNAME>: I am ready.~
@2808 = ~I had a dream last night. You were wearing a long white dress... until you weren't.~
@2809 = ~(He presents you a miniature dragon figure, masterfully carved out of ice. The dragon looks at you sullenly, and there is something very familiar in his gaze... a mirror image of you in a bad mood, in fact. Xan only smiles.)~
@2810 = ~(Your cloak's hood falls around your shoulder. Xan deftly adjusts it, and, without missing a beat, keeps walking.)~
@2811 = ~(You catch him looking at you, an unguarded expression on his face. Noticing your gaze, he smiles.)~
@2812 = ~(Xan is drawing your image again on a piece of paper. This time, there is a naked dagger in your hand, and... was that a naked breast?)~
@2813 = ~(He is shelling pistachio nuts, carefully deposing the results in a green silken bag. Noticing that you've noticed, he offers the bag to you.)~
@2814 = ~Oooh, nuts!!~
@2815 = ~Thank you, Xan.~
@2816 = ~Looks good.~
@2817 = ~(The nuts are surprisingly fresh and rich in flavor.)~
@2818 = ~(He unceremoniously takes your nearly empty water flask, mutters a spell, and it fills anew with clean water. Another hand wave, and the cork becomes pristine clean. Without another word, Xan places the flask back in your pack and smiles.)~
@2819 = ~(Your neck suddenly does not feel tense anymore. You realize that your backpack has become much lighter.)~
@2820 = ~A levitating cantrip. Will exhaust itself in ten minutes, but you'll have some rest.~
@2821 = ~(He is writing in his journal again, looking at you from time to time. Noticing your interest, Xan firmly shakes his hand and puts the journal away.)~
@2822 = ~We should have a game of chess sometime. Or two. Mind you, I still hope to win.~
@2823 = ~There is so much I'd like to know about your childhood. Candlekeep, the smell of the sea, your chores, the light in your room, your first book... your first memory. When this is over, I'll want to sit with you and talk for hours on end.~
@2824 = ~(He leans in and kisses you. It is warm and pleasant, and you are breathless for a few moments after it ends.)~
@2825 = ~(He reaches and wipes a few drops of blood from your wrist.) Here... it is clean now.~
@2826 = ~Seldarine, will it ever end?~
@2827 = ~I had another dream about you. You'd never guess what it was about.~
@2828 = ~(He presents you with a yellow rose with red tinge around the edges. It still has fresh dew between the petals.)~
@2829 = ~(Xan deftly tucks it behind your ear and smiles.) It becomes you, melamin.~
@2830 = ~<CHARNAME>. Did Gorion give you that name, or did you take it when you became a little older? Or was it your mother?~
@2831 = ~Regardless, I love the way it sounds: <CHARNAME>.~
@2832 = ~We are running out of butter. If you want our group to have pancakes for breakfast, something must be done now. Unless you need time to strategize?~
@2833 = ~(He sighs, closing his spellbook.) I am not getting enough sleep to memorize all this.~
@2834 = ~I always wondered why they needed to make robes and armor so bulky. It is a pity we cannot enchant a tunic for you, or a long, low cut dress. You would be conquering with beauty, not blood.~
@2835 = ~(He holds you for a moment, reluctant to let go.)~
@2836 = ~They say that objective reality surrounds us. It is given to us through our senses and feelings - mostly unpleasant, I must say. But my subjective reality is you.~
@2837 = ~I bought two bottles of Elverquisst in Suldanessellar. Would you like a drink?~
@2838 = ~Naturally!~
@2839 = ~Not right now.~
@2840 = ~(Xan pours you a glass.) To us, melamin.~
@2841 = ~(He takes your hand and draws a small pattern on it. You look down and see a small magical flame dancing on your palm, licking your fingers, but not hurting them. It flickers, then disappears.)~
@2842 = ~(Your palm feels comfortably warm long after.)~
@2843 = ~I keep looking into your eyes, but they always seem to change color - like an endless sea.~
@2844 = ~If we ever travel to an unexplored land and walk along the new shores, I shall call the waves with your name.~
@2845 = ~<CHARNAME>? You don't know anyone who would get into my private supply of spell components, do you? Someone left a note there saying "Xan and <CHARNAME> sitting in a tree"... I wonder why.~
@2846 = ~(He stops you, relieves you of your backpack and cloak, and as you sit on a large stone, Xan works on your shoulders for a spell, his fingers tenderly massaging right below your shoulder blades, and caressing your neck.)~
@2847 = ~You know, a certain enchanter acquired a small jar of whipped cream, and I... ah, he was wondering whether you actually had any ideas as to what to do with it?~
@2848 = ~Tonight, perhaps?~
@2849 = ~I just wanted to say: that little robe you wore last night - you looked stunning in it. And without it... but my lips are sealed.~
@2850 = ~(He takes your hands in one of his and passes another hand over your fingers. Something sparkles in the air, and both of your rings suddenly shine like new.)~
@2851 = ~I keep thinking we missed a locked chest somewhere... but I cannot, for the life of me, remember where. Do you know the feeling?~
@2852 = ~(He caresses your face, his own a little distant.)~
@2853 = ~What are you thinking of?~
@2854 = ~Hey. Are you all here?~
@2855 = ~I was just... remembering. Our first kiss. May I?..~
@2856 = ~(Without waiting for your reply, he hesitantly touches your lips with his, cradling your face with his palms, caressing your forehead and nose, and finally catching your lips once more before letting go.)~
@2857 = ~You bring out certain parts in me that puzzle even myself. Why, just now I thought of frolicking through the meadows with you, picking flowers, and -~
@2858 = ~Can you imagine?... Oh. Don't start. Just don't.~
@2859 = ~(You notice him looking at you with naked adoration.)~
@2860 = ~I would love to paint the moment, but then I won't be able to keep it fully in my memory. I am so greedy, <CHARNAME>: I want both, and as much as possible.~
@2861 = ~(He is daydreaming again, but his eyes shine anew as they rest at you.)~
@2862 = ~Let us run away. To the mountains, to Candlekeep, to Neverwinter, to Sigil itself - but leave this cursed business with the Five behind. Just you and me.~
@2863 = ~(sigh) Dreaming the dream, I suppose.~
@2864 = ~I was wondering if you'd like to have a foot massage right now. Do we have the time?~
@2865 = ~Perhaps later.~
@2866 = ~Later it is, then.~
@2867 = ~(You sit down, and Xan relieves you of your shoes and garb, before placing your left foot on his knee. Slowly, with tender circular movements, he starts massaging it, until it feels ready to walk on clouds.)~
@2868 = ~(He kneads it rhythmically, until it almost tingles with content, and starts with the other foot. When it is done, you are ready to go... but your feet are loudly demanding to stay. They may well be starting a conspiracy to get closer to Xan again, especially after the march is over.)~
@2869 = ~You are beautiful. Banal it may be, but every time I look at you, I see it anew.~
@2870 = ~And real beauty lies beyond the eyes.~
@2871 = ~I am still thinking of running away. Sealing ourselves in Watcher's Keep, maybe. Perhaps this Solar of yours won't find us there.~
@2872 = ~(sigh) A hollow hope, that.~
@2873 = ~I saw your face in the stars again last night. You were smiling at the moon.~
@2874 = ~(He kisses your hair.)~
@2875 = ~I love you.~
@2876 = ~(He touches your shoulder.)~
@2877 = ~<CHARNAME>... do not go. Please do not go.~
@2878 = ~(Xan smiles at you. There is a very young expression on his face - he must have looked like this before he claimed the moonblade.)~
@2879 = ~All prophecies end, <CHARNAME>. We shall be free.~
@2880 = ~A home. We shall have a home. I am looking forward to it.~
@2881 = ~(He shivers visibly.)~
@2882 = ~The end is so close now... I can almost taste it. Bitterness, and pain, and battle.~
@2883 = ~And peace. Will we have peace, Estel'amin?~
@2884 = ~I am going to whisper it in your ear one time, and only one.~
@2885 = ~(He leans to you, his hair tickling you neck.)~
@2886 = ~We are not doomed.~
@2887 = ~(Xan looks at you, and you see love in his eyes.)~ [O#XAN000]
@2888 = ~(Hug Xan)~
@2889 = ~(Kiss Xan)~
@2890 = ~(Hold hands)~
@2891 = ~(Look at Xan)~
@2892 = ~(Smile at Xan)~
@2893 = ~(Kiss Xan's cheek)~
@2894 = ~(Walk next to Xan)~
@2895 = ~Tell me a limerick.~
@2896 = ~I want you tonight.~
@2897 = ~Surprise me with something tasty.~
@2898 = ~I am so glad you are still by my side.~
@2899 = ~The end draws close. Do you feel it?~
@2900 = ~(He returns your embrace warmly, his lips lingering on your brow for a moment.)~
@2901 = ~(Xan wraps his arms around your shoulders and whispers something gentle in your ear.)~
@2902 = ~(You find shelter in each other's arms, and as you part, there is a small smile hiding in the corner of Xan's mouth.)~
@2903 = ~(Xan sighs almost contentedly as you put your head on his shoulder.)~
@2904 = ~(Xan says nothing and strokes your hair absently, his mind on something else.)~
@2905 = ~(Xan raises an eyebrow, but takes you into his arms. He remains focused on the surroundings, though, and his body is tense.)~
@2906 = ~(For a spell, your bodies melt into each other. Xan's robes are thin, and you feel his warmth underneath.)~
@2907 = ~(Xan holds you in his arms with unusual force, as if he is afraid you'll disappear.)~
@2908 = ~(He looks sad and serious, but returns the embrace anyway. As you part, you feel his gaze on you for a while.)~
@2909 = ~(Xan shakes his head warningly.) I am preparing a spell, <CHARNAME>. You'd do well to stand back.~
@2910 = ~(The kiss is brief, but passionate.)~
@2911 = ~Command me, <CHARNAME>, and tonight I'll get the moon for you.~
@2912 = ~(When Xan's eyes open again after the kiss, they are much darker than usual.)~
@2913 = ~(His mouth tastes of grapes and the sun, and for a moment you hear the distant sea.)~
@2914 = ~(Xan returns your kiss with ardor, and soon you are both out of breath, your faces burning hot.)~
@2915 = ~(His lips are warm and dry, but a little hesitant in touching yours. It looks like Xan's mind is on something else again.)~
@2916 = ~<CHARNAME>, melamin... if I kiss you now, I will be useless for hours later. Let us leave it for the night.~
@2917 = ~(It is a short, almost friendly, kiss, but as your lips part, Xan kisses you again - strongly, impulsively. He doesn't let go quickly this time.)~
@2918 = ~Mmm. Have I ever told you how good it feels to kiss you?~
@2919 = ~Mmm... ah, and she is walking away, I see. (sigh) You are a tease, <CHARNAME>, do you know that?~
@2920 = ~(He kisses you for a long, long time, until you are positively sure the entire party and a few passers-by stopped to look.)~
@2921 = ~(Xan gives you a small smile as you take his hand.)~
@2922 = ~(There is a scar on the inner side of his wrist, going down the arm. You can hear Xan sighing as your fingers glide along it.)~
@2923 = ~(Xan's hand closes around yours, and you walk hand in hand.)~
@2924 = ~(Xan takes your hand in both of his and slowly brings it to his lips.)~
@2925 = ~A'maelamin.~
@2926 = ~(Xan's fingers draw circles on your palm, as they are prone to doing. He smiles privately as you recognize your name again in the patterns.)~
@2927 = ~(Xan looks down at your joined hands and smiles.)~
@2928 = ~I never tire of it. When the roads are less dangerous, I plan on holding your hand hostage and never letting it go. Well... unless asked nicely, I suppose.~
@2929 = ~And now my life is complete. (Xan's tone is serious, but his eyes smile at you.)~
@2930 = ~Sometimes I feel as if even your hand is trying to tell me "We're not doomed."~
@2931 = ~It... doesn't any habits like that, does it?~
@2932 = ~(Xan's hand closes around yours, silently reassuring you that everything is going to be all right.)~
@2933 = ~(It is unlikely that Xan is aware of what his hand is saying, however.)~
@2934 = ~What's the po...?~
@2935 = ~Oh, no. Give it here.~
@2936 = ~(Xan's hand firmly wraps against yours. At the moment, one could even say he looks a little possessive - and proud of it.)~
@2937 = ~(Xan's expression is a little dreamy. He tends to look like this when he is either recalling last night's events... or planning something for the next one.)~
@2938 = ~(Not particularly tall or imposing, he still has a way of holding himself - and the sword belt compliments his narrow waist quite nicely. There are many ways to undo the said belt, to be sure.)~
@2939 = ~(The encounter with Bodhi changed Xan's bearing. Where before he used to stumble or stare on the ground, now he stands tall and looks toward the moon. His gaze is more alive, too, as if he does not want to miss a minute of his newfound life.)~
@2940 = ~(Xan tosses his hair over the shoulder with nonchalance: it grew a little longer in Suldanessellar. But he himself changed little during these months, although he started smiling more often since you regained your spirit.)~
@2941 = ~(Xan returns your gaze with an inquiring look.) Is anything amiss, <CHARNAME>?~
@2942 = ~(Xan's dark eyes rest on your surroundings, and you take a minute to study his face. Young, like all elven faces, it looks more distant, as if your journeys and pains have extracted their toll. But he turns his head, smiles at you, and the impression is gone.)~
@2943 = ~(Slight but well-built, he and his blade seem a perfect fit, although you well remember what nearly happened at the graveyard, and what may still happen after Xan dies.)~
@2944 = ~(Xan's fingers stroke the blade's hilt absently - and suddenly his hand falls, curled into a fist, and he bites his lip. Apparently trying to cover the display, he pulls his cloak tighter around himself.)~
@2945 = ~(Elven and handsome, he nevertheless looks sad and drawn - and you saw him scribbling in his diary again a minute ago. Something is pressing on him, much like your destiny seems to be pressed upon you.)~
@2946 = ~(Perhaps these two are one and the same.)~
@2947 = ~(You study Xan's profile for a while. He does not seem to notice, but you could swear he tilted his head twice to give you a better view.)~
@2948 = ~Ah, <CHARNAME>. Do you... like anything you see?~
@2949 = ~(Xan smiles back - an open and a happy smile.)~
@2950 = ~(If Xan's answering smile does not say "I love you" aloud, it's because his lips silently say it right afterwards.)~
@2951 = ~(Xan's smile is a little sad, but it is a smile nevertheless. He turns away all too quickly, though.)~
@2952 = ~And once again I am tempted to say: "We are not doomed." How quickly things change, don't they?~
@2953 = ~Smile, melamin. The world shines brighter when you do.~
@2954 = ~And suddenly I suspect you are planning something truly nefarious. Not a tickling attack, I trust?~
@2955 = ~(Xan smiles back with his eyes only - which, for a second, stop being dark and become warm brown.)~
@2956 = ~The majesty of your smile makes me feel insignificant.~
@2957 = ~(But he smiles anyway.)~
@2958 = ~(Xan raises an eyebrow.) I keep thinking you know some happy secret. Would you like to share?~
@2959 = ~If your smile was a magical weapon, it would kill dragons with a single sweep. I'd hate to see how much a merchant would charge for it, though.~
@2960 = ~Mmm. It was nice. What for?~
@2961 = ~You are in a good mood, I see. I am glad.~
@2962 = ~Why, thank you!~
@2963 = ~I still think we are all doomed, mind you.~
@2964 = ~(Xan kisses your cheek - and stands still for a moment as he drinks in your fragrance.)~
@2965 = ~(His skin is warm and smooth - and a little pink, now that you've kissed him.)~
@2966 = ~(Xan smiles in surprise... and as you walk away, he stands still, one hand on his cheek.)~
@2967 = ~(For some reason, Xan's robes smell of dried roses - and, sure enough, you find an impossibly white dried rose in your pocket as you kiss his cheek and withdraw.)~
@2968 = ~And I love you, too.~
@2969 = ~(As you turn to go, he draws you near and kisses you - fully - on the lips.)~
@2970 = ~(Xan gives you a small nod, and you walk side by side in comfortable silence.)~
@2971 = ~(As you walk right next to Xan, he silently takes your hand, and you continue arm in arm.)~
@2972 = ~I am glad for the company.~
@2973 = ~(You walk a little too close, and his body reacts immediately - you can definitely feel heat radiating from his side and shoulder.)~
@2974 = ~(Xan smiles as you approach.) Hello, <CHARNAME>. Want some company?~
@2975 = ~(Xan walks a little closer to you, as well, and your steps fall into the same familiar rhythm.)~
@2976 = ~(Xan is definitely paying attention to your legs. Perhaps too much, for he stumbles more than once.)~
@2977 = ~(Xan drapes an arm around your waist, and you continue walking, his body warm against yours.)~
@2978 = ~I would rather you paid attention to the road. But... I won't say I'm not happy about it.~
@2979 = ~(Xan's eyes smile at you, and there's definitely a new spring in his step.)~
@2980 = ~An elf who was ever so small
Once asked seven orcs to play ball.
For breakfast they came,
It was a great shame:
All eight were consumed by a troll.~
@2981 = ~There was once an elf who was doomed.
He panicked, he ran, and he fumed.
But all through his way
He thought every day
Of smelling his lover's perfume.~
@2982 = ~I knew a dark lord from the Gate.
He wanted to turn his own fate
To start a long war
Ask for an encore
And rob both his fathers he hated.~
@2983 = ~There was once a lady divine,
Her body and soul very fine.
But once she looked down
An elf she has found
And now she is happily mine.~
@2984 = ~There was once a girl from the Keep,
Who never thought anything deep.
A thief, yes, she was
Opposed things morose
And yet Lord of Death got her nose.~
@2985 = ~I went outside in the rain
Intending to visit the Planes.
I found a wrong portal
Forgot I was mortal
And danced with a Balor all day.~
@2986 = ~A High Mage once weathered a battle
Enduring his colleagues's prattle.
He got very tired
But also inspired
And quickly invented a rattle.~
@2987 = ~A daring and beautiful girl
Decided to go on a roll:
She took off her clothes
And lay in repose
And nobody minded at all.~
@2988 = ~A golem who slaughtered six pigeons
Went out to find a religion.
He found an old sage,
But she was a mage,
And smashed the construct with precision.~
@2989 = ~A beautiful offspring of Bhaal
Decided to go to a ball.
She went dressed in red,
All gentlemen dropped dead
And ladies kept hissing: "What gall!"~
@2990 = ~Now that's a thought.~
@2991 = ~(Xan smiles.) Well, we can't very well have you not having what you want, can we?~
@2992 = ~Absolutely. Shall I tell you my ideas on that account?~
@2993 = ~Tying a naughty Bhaalspawn up, or letting her run amok? That *is* the question.~
@2994 = ~And I am doomed, I see.~
@2995 = ~Oh. By the way, since we are doomed anyway, can we get to it a little faster?~
@2996 = ~And we are in complete agreement yet again, it seems.~
@2997 = ~I've always wanted to try a certain spell... Hmm. Do you mind levitation?~
@2998 = ~Ya... Oh. Sorry. Won't happen again. What I mean to say is - yes, of course. Absolutely.~
@2999 = ~(Xan looks almost disappointed.) Not right now?~
@3000 = ~(Without missing a bit, Xan presents you with a freshly washed bowl of fresh dates, dark and inviting... just like Xan's eyes.)~
@3001 = ~How about an avocado? You know what it rhymes with in Elven? "I am glad to see you."~
@3002 = ~I've still got a few figs. You are welcome to them.~
@3003 = ~Just remember, you need to cleanse your palette afterwards, or it will sting a little. I've heard that a kiss is a perfect remedy.~
@3004 = ~How about an ice cream?~
@3005 = ~Yes!~
@3006 = ~I'd like one.~
@3007 = ~Wherewherewhere I WANT MY ICE CREAM NOW!!~
@3008 = ~Maybe another time.~
@3009 = ~... And the ice cream is doomed, it seems. Here you go.~
@3010 = ~I had some Amnish honey somewhere, but... no, it's all gone. Perhaps a cache of nuts, instead?~
@3011 = ~(Xan offers you juicy, yellow, fresh bits of mango.)~
@3012 = ~How about some black chocolate? It's on the bottom of my pack; we'll stop for a break later.~
@3013 = ~You won't believe me, but I found a few raspberries in the forest. Here... they are yours.~
@3014 = ~I have a whole box of Calimshan delights... rahat-lokum they call them. Careful, they are very sweet.~
@3015 = ~There was a bit of cheese from breakfast... wait... yes, here it is. You want it cut in thin pieces?~
@3016 = ~I shall always be by your side, Estel'amin. For as long as you want me to.~
@3017 = ~So am I. To think that I could die in Bodhi's lair... unthinkable. You saved me, melamin.~
@3018 = ~My best delight and joy.~
@3019 = ~If you like, we could use an invisibility spell for a few minutes, and *then* I would gladly show you how happy I am to remain at your side.~
@3020 = ~We are alive, alive, alive. I swear, I could sing it sometimes.~
@3021 = ~From the very mines of Nashkel - to your own pocket plane. And still, we are together. Amazing, isn't it?~
@3022 = ~You will always have me, melamin. Always.~
@3023 = ~And I am glad to see your face every morning. I see you in reverie and wake up with you in my arms... it is happiness of the highest order.~
@3024 = ~(Xan kisses you in return.)~
@3025 = ~Here it is - happiness. And you. Truly, these days I can't tell one from the other.~
@3026 = ~(sigh) Until the inevitable doom comes, I suppose.~
@3027 = ~I do not want to, but I do. And it makes my heart ache. I do not want us to be over, <CHARNAME>.~
@3028 = ~Melamin... don't.~
@3029 = ~Will it truly be over? Will you leave? I cannot get these questions out of my head, melamin. Even in your arms, I cannot.~
@3030 = ~I feel what I feel for you, and no ending can change that.~
@3031 = ~There is sadness in endings. But we will have a new beginning.~
@3032 = ~(Xan smiles at you.) Nothing is ending while we are together, <CHARNAME>.~
@3033 = ~We are doomed to see the axe fall, yes. But even in the worst doom, there is victory.~
@3034 = ~Well, at least we'll see your Solar for the last time. There is some silver lining in that, I suppose.~
@3035 = ~I do not want to believe it. But perhaps there is yet another adventure just around the corner? We just cannot see it yet.~
@3036 = ~I love you. And I take comfort in that.~
@3037 = ~If I ascend, will you become my Chosen?~
@3038 = ~Where would you like to go, if we both survive this?~
@3039 = ~I am tired of walking, dust, dirt and endless monster-slaying! Don't I deserve a clean bed and a hot meal?~
@3040 = ~Let's discuss marriage and kids. And a wedding.~
@3041 = ~I had a dream of an adventure we had in Neverwinter.~
@3042 = ~People died in Saradush. And we couldn't prevent it...~
@3043 = ~How about we cut your hair?~
@3044 = ~Will you remain a mage forever? Magic is dangerous.~
@3045 = ~Tell me a story.~
@3046 = ~Tell me another story.~
@3047 = ~A story? Please?~
@3048 = ~They say that elves like you and me are racists. Like it's a bad thing!~
@3049 = ~You are my best friend, do you know this?~
@3050 = ~Solar told me Corellon Larethian sent us visions of your death in the graveyard.~
@3051 = ~When did you get that scar under your arm? It is fresh.~
@3052 = ~This picture of me - where did you get it?~
@3053 = ~The life we are planning after this is over - isn't it too unchanging and serene, like an afterlife, the kingdom of the dead?~
@3054 = ~The gods will continue their games long after the Throne of Bhaal. I feel something horrible will happen.~
@3055 = ~What are you studying? Wait, are you researching portals?~
@3056 = ~Do you ever think of what you could become in other circumstances? Of other Xans, in other realities?~
@3057 = ~Of all our adventures in Baldur's Gate and Athkatla, do you regret anything?~
@3058 = ~A... Chosen? Of you?~
@3059 = ~Why me, and not Imoen, for one? Not any of the others?~
@3060 = ~Imoen is dead.~
@3061 = ~I don't like Imoen. You are my friend.~
@3062 = ~Imoen and I will talk, but it is your answer I want now.~
@3063 = ~I'll ask them. But now I am asking you.~
@3064 = ~Because you are one of my best friends, and your answer matters to me.~
@3065 = ~Oh, please. Imoen? She never dies.~
@3066 = ~<CHARNAME>, you have my loyalty. I do not think I've ever met anyone like you, in fact - an amazing person, and a true friend.~
@3067 = ~But... no. If you are going to stay mortal, and need my company - you shall have it, albeit I will need to return to my city eventually. But I cannot turn away from my god, and my people.~
@3068 = ~I understand, Xan. But I had to ask.~
@3069 = ~So you'd choose Corellon over me?~
@3070 = ~Won't you reconsider? I could use a High Priest like you.~
@3071 = ~Do you think I will become another Bhaal?~
@3072 = ~(Xan shakes his head.) Forgive me. It is an honor that you asked, but - I simply cannot. It is not about your deeds, or my devotion to my people - rather, it is a strong feeling in my heart that it is your destiny to follow, and I have mine.~
@3073 = ~If you ascend, we will have to part. But I shall wish you the best, as I do now.~
@3074 = ~Just choose carefully, mellonamin. There will be no way back.~
@3075 = ~Would you truly choose this path?~
@3076 = ~We are immortal, but I do not want to spend eternity in the forests of Arvandor. I want to be someone.~
@3077 = ~I would, and I am trying to share it with you the best I can.~
@3078 = ~I have my doubts, but I want you to be with me if it happens.~
@3079 = ~Wouldn't you?~
@3080 = ~(sigh) Oh, <CHARNAME>...~
@3081 = ~There are words which are as hard to say as they are to hear. You know what I am about to say, don't you?~
@3082 = ~Your answer is ''no"?~
@3083 = ~No, I do not. Say it.~
@3084 = ~Please, please reconsider.~
@3085 = ~I cannot, <CHARNAME>. I will not follow you to the stars.~
@3086 = ~We have found our way to each other, and I will give up anything for you. But if you are walking away... I cannot find it in me to follow.~
@3087 = ~It sounds too cruel.~
@3088 = ~But I love you!~
@3089 = ~Elminster was Mystra's lover. You could become mine.~
@3090 = ~Yet it is what it is.~
@3091 = ~Yet not enough to stay? Do you love me, then, if you leave and expect me to remain here, to do your bidding?~
@3092 = ~To what end? To be abandoned as a toy a hundred years later? To be one of many sights you set your divine eyes on? To be told "no, I have a war with Cyric to plan, I'll see you later"?~
@3093 = ~I realize I am guilty of much when it comes to you and me. But I will not walk away from you. There is a long, full life that can await us here, and time eternal in the Blessed Realm - together.~
@3094 = ~Won't it ever be enough?~
@3095 = ~You are set on breaking my heart, aren't you?~
@3096 = ~There is a future for us out there, Xan. I can see it.~
@3097 = ~I love you. But I cannot give up becoming a goddess, I will resent you too much.~
@3098 = ~I want the best for me. And I do not want to lose you.~
@3099 = ~And I can see a future for us here - but in your quest for power, you won't notice it.~
@3100 = ~This much I can understand. And you think I will not resent you? (sigh) Although of course I will not - I cannot, in fact.~
@3101 = ~You are candid, at least.~
@3102 = ~And with one word, you doom me. Story of my life.~
@3103 = ~I...~
@3104 = ~I will stay here. I will think of you, and pray for you, and look at the stars.~
@3105 = ~You know I won't stop trying to find you among the Planes, even though a goddess cannot love a mortal man - or an immortal elf. I will give all of myself, if you are in danger.~
@3106 = ~But please, stay. There are new adventures, if you'll have them. New roads to explore, companions to meet, old friends and enemies you simply cannot leave behind. A home to build. Me.~
@3107 = ~I will stay. Never mind all I said before, I will stay with you.~
@3108 = ~I only hope that when the time comes, we will be together.~
@3109 = ~If I ascend, I will come for you, Xan, I swear it.~
@3110 = ~Oh, forget it. You'd be a lousy Chosen, anyway.~
@3111 = ~You haven't given your answer to Solar yet.~
@3112 = ~(But Xan cannot help a smile, and in his voice, you hear relief.)~
@3113 = ~Much will change in the coming days. But when it comes to whether you'll stay with me, I have only one answer.~
@3114 = ~(Xan gives you a small smile.) Does it mean you are staying?~
@3115 = ~We'll see.~
@3116 = ~Depends. Do I get an ice cream?~
@3117 = ~Sure I am. It'll be boring without you, anyway.~
@3118 = ~I cannot answer yet.~
@3119 = ~I hope you do.~
@3120 = ~Ah. So it all was an elaborate ploy to get the password to the secret ice cream stash, I see. Did you ever try using your own name?~
@3121 = ~Here you go.~
@3122 = ~Home, I think. I haven't been there for ages, and, truthfully, there were moments I didn't expect to see it again - not from Spellhold, or the Underdark, or... or Bodhi's lair.~
@3123 = ~But if we survive, I would dearly like to go there with you.~
@3124 = ~If you want me to, I'll gladly join you.~
@3125 = ~Sure thing! It's my house, too, right?~
@3126 = ~We could visit, if not stay.~
@3127 = ~Tell me more about it.~
@3128 = ~There are other places I'd like to visit.~
@3129 = ~Then we shall, of course. But some day, if you are willing...~
@3130 = ~It is your house, as well. If you recall, I recorded the fact in Evereska when I went there after Sarevok's first death.~
@3131 = ~It is very quiet, and beautiful. I never expected I'd miss the running water so. The statue of Hanali... the roses... my mother writing letters on the western terrace.~
@3132 = ~My father practicing with his blade in the garden, and me, spying at him from the bushes. Of course, he knew I was there all along, but the moment still shames me.~
@3133 = ~If you want, we could live there, or stay for a while. I will need to establish a portal eventually: as the last scion of a prominent family, I'll likely have duties, if... well, if they don't throw us out outright.~
@3134 = ~So, yes, I would like to see Evereska again, and even more - for you to see it. I wish my parents were not gone... They would admire you, I can tell.~
@3135 = ~Really? A Bhaalspawn for a daughter-in-law?~
@3136 = ~I am sorry. I would've liked to meet them.~
@3137 = ~We can start a family there, too, you know. And your son will spy you practicing magic.~
@3138 = ~You do not need to be "the last scion". We could continue your line. Our line.~
@3139 = ~Well, you know what they say: it's best to marry an orphan.~
@3140 = ~If they don't let us in, we could always take over the city.~
@3141 = ~With my luck, they could do much worse. One of Bodhi's vampires, for example.~
@3142 = ~(Xan suppresses a shudder.)~
@3143 = ~But it's the past.~
@3144 = ~And I. Mother sometimes said I would need someone very special to break me up from my melancholy, although I did not understand at the time why she'd call it such.~
@3145 = ~But now, perhaps, I do. And you are not simply special - you are unique.~
@3146 = ~I would be happy to. Although you know me: I would endlessly worry for your health, and fret, until you won't hear another "hopeless" from my lips.~
@3147 = ~But it could be its own great adventure. A son. A daughter. A story waiting to come alive... and a future.~
@3148 = ~(Xan smiles at you.) It will be amazing.~
@3149 = ~(sigh) <CHARNAME>, you and the entirely inappropriate way you sometimes use your humor...~
@3150 = ~What's left of the city, you mean? I doubt we will find my home intact - or any building in Evereska, come to think of it. No, it's best to wait and see.~
@3151 = ~Tell me, where would you want us to go? So many chances... so many places. Assuming we survive, of course.~
@3152 = ~Of course. But Evereska is fine: I'd like to see it.~
@3153 = ~All of it! Jungles, other continents, different Planes, even.~
@3154 = ~Just somewhere quiet. I don't know yet.~
@3155 = ~I don't care, as long as it is with you.~
@3156 = ~We'll decide when the time comes, I suppose. If...~
@3157 = ~(sigh) No matter.~
@3158 = ~You look nice when you are complaining. Hmm... should I join you?~
@3159 = ~Go on! The more the merrier.~
@3160 = ~What? No! Don't steal my thunder.~
@3161 = ~And here Xan starts complaining, too. Gods, everything is so horrible...~
@3162 = ~Don't you patronize me! Anyway, where was I?~
@3163 = ~In bringing me a hot meal and a clean bed? Absolutely.~
@3164 = ~I hate this life.~
@3165 = ~No, I think I'd rather leave you the privilege.~
@3166 = ~When it comes to a hot meal, I can help. That is, if you'd like a mushroom stew with some vegetables. I'm told it wakes the appetite if cooked with garlic. Strange, isn't it? You smell garlic and think of red meat... I thought it was a human thing, but I found myself susceptible to it, as well.~
@3167 = ~It's called "steak".~
@3168 = ~Mushrooms, vegetables... Where's the beef?~
@3169 = ~All right. But mind you, I'll keep complaining all the way into the deep night!~
@3170 = ~Please do.~
@3171 = ~As long as it's not fried demon.~
@3172 = ~No, thanks. I'd rather have a healthy meat lasagna.~
@3173 = ~(Xan wrinkles his nose and sighs.) The word came from some high-mountain barbarians or slavers from the southern tribes, I do not doubt. But as long as it takes your mind off complaining...~
@3174 = ~Then you shall have it. Although judging by the gleam in your eye and the amount of hungry companions we have, I'll be left with a lone crust of bread, and maybe a spoonful of sauce. Such is the fate of all culinary would-be heroes.~
@3175 = ~But you were talking of other things. Dust, and dirt, and monsters. (sigh) Now I am definitely in the mood to complain, as well. Should I add doom? I would like to add doom.~
@3176 = ~As long as you take out sarcasm.~
@3177 = ~It was my complaining. Mine! Find your own!~
@3178 = ~Oh, fine. We're all doomed. Happy?~
@3179 = ~Not in this lifetime. And, yes, it IS worth an effort of trying. I just want to complain.~
@3180 = ~And we are back to where we started: you do look nice when you are complaining.~
@3181 = ~If you'd like to complain some more, I'm all ears. Just... don't take it all out on me. Remember, the others need your words of guidance, too.~
@3182 = ~(Xan blinks.) Do you mean, whether we'll have them at all?~
@3183 = ~I do. It's best to know now where we stand on these matters, right?~
@3184 = ~I'd like to marry you, and I want a beautiful wedding, but no children whatsoever.~
@3185 = ~I always wanted to have a wonderful family with you. And children. Or perhaps one child.~
@3186 = ~Do you want us to marry?~
@3187 = ~What do you think about it?~
@3188 = ~Would you like us to have children?~
@3189 = ~I... would much rather leave the matter to you, actually. We are bonded - you know that to me it matters much more than a marriage in the halls of Waukeen's temple or whatever else they have here in Tethyr. And as for starting a family...~
@3190 = ~Again, it is up to you. You know that the physical burden lies with you until the child is born, so you alone can decide. If you want us to have a son or a daughter - or more than one, I am with you. If not, I'll live a happy life - with you.~
@3191 = ~But you don't have a preference?~
@3192 = ~Good choice. I'll decide, then.~
@3193 = ~I'd still like you to choose, too.~
@3194 = ~<CHARNAME>, I cannot put anything - not my moonblade, not my service to my people and certainly not money, honors or any imaginary future children or wedding rings higher than your happiness. It is not a lack of caring or preference - it is simply how it is.~
@3195 = ~I've never been a father or a husband, so I cannot compare. But I know I do not want to be either, if it makes you resentful - and I'll happily become both, if it makes your eyes shine.~
@3196 = ~So, it shall be as you say, a'maelamin. Although I do reserve the right to mention that we are doomed if you invite a certain redhead to be your bridesmaid, and things will definitely be out of hand if thrice-resurrected Sarevok walks you down the isle - most likely, the priests will run away. And children may probably find me a surprisingly strict father at times.~
@3197 = ~But all in all, if we survive all this, I find our chances for happiness rather... happy.~
@3198 = ~And that makes me happy!~
@3199 = ~Good. I'll make an optimist out of you yet.~
@3200 = ~And that's a big if.~
@3201 = ~I am sure a pair of dragons will turn up sooner or... sooner. But until they haven't - a kiss?~
@3202 = ~Or two. Or many...~
@3203 = ~Thank the Seldarine it wasn't in Thay. So what did we do?~
@3204 = ~Protected the city from terrible danger, naturally.~
@3205 = ~There was an army of invaders, a plague, a war... and a betrayal, too, I think.~
@3206 = ~We had to kill lots of people. Looted them, too.~
@3207 = ~We were called upon to give ourselves to the taint for the greater good... Wait. No. Wrong dream.~
@3208 = ~Oh, it was just a lot of fighting. No time to talk at all.~
@3209 = ~(sigh) Why am I not surprised...~
@3210 = ~I am almost loath to ask, but did it turn out well in the end?~
@3211 = ~Someone was hanged and someone was burnt, but it was more or less fine for us, yeah.~
@3212 = ~Did we win? Yes.~
@3213 = ~You didn't see much of it, actually: I exchanged you for a singing kobold. You stayed in the camp and identified my items.~
@3214 = ~I don't really remember... I think you got eaten by a dragon.~
@3215 = ~(groan) Wonderful.~
@3216 = ~At least we escaped the city *before* someone noticed the amount of destruction you created, I hope.~
@3217 = ~But it is nice to think of saving the world again. Although much of it is pointless, and things always revert to the way they were... but when evil is finally routed, for a minute or two you simply want to believe it will stay that way.~
@3218 = ~And I do believe.~
@3219 = ~Hey, I just saved Neverwinter! I'm officially proclaiming myself its champion, hero, and... hmm. I think I'll ask for a big statue.~
@3220 = ~We also must get by, somehow. Adventuring is all I do.~
@3221 = ~It's not pointless. Even as generations pass, people will remember us, Xan.~
@3222 = ~And I believe in you.~
@3223 = ~Old statues and tales will not preserve your image, <CHARNAME>. Nobody remembers the truth within a decade, if not earlier.~
@3224 = ~But if it makes you sleep better at night, so be it.~
@3225 = ~"Get by" and "she stores a few hundred thousand in her backpack" are two rather different things, don't you think?~
@3226 = ~Although when you think of robes, staffs and relics of old, wrought by the long gone sages... I admit I am curious, too.~
@3227 = ~Adventuring together. I wonder, will we turn into someone like Khalid and Jaheira? Were they ever like us?~
@3228 = ~Maybe we'll meet our own ward some day.~
@3229 = ~Impossible! We are much more in love than they were.~
@3230 = ~I will never lose you like Jaheira lost Khalid, I swear.~
@3231 = ~As long it is not Cyric in disguise, I suppose.~
@3232 = ~I will not argue with that. Yet they, two, were happy, in their own way.~
@3233 = ~And I hope I will never have to lose you.~
@3234 = ~Truthfully, I'd rather travel with you to Neverwinter wood than remain in Tethyr's scorching heat. Or in the gloom of your pocket plane. Perhaps in a few years?~
@3235 = ~(sigh) As long as this new adventure doesn't doom us together with the city, I suppose.~
@3236 = ~An entire city. Devastated.~
@3237 = ~I can't say I'm surprised, but... it was a blow. All these faces - dead now.~
@3238 = ~Were we truly helpless to prevent this, do you think?~
@3239 = ~We'll always shoulder some of the blame. But it was Yaga-Shura.~
@3240 = ~Unless you have a time machine, yes, we were.~
@3241 = ~I keep thinking we could have done something.~
@3242 = ~I truly do not know.~
@3243 = ~So it was, but I never was an admirer of stating the obvious.~
@3244 = ~(Xan smiles without mirth.) Had I a time machine, you'd have never lost your soul, Estel'amin.~
@3245 = ~And I. It gets impossible sometimes, do you feel it? As if you can't wake up.~
@3246 = ~I don't think I can do anything to forget it quickly. Although I want to - part of me feels like it was simply an annoyance, a loss in a chess game forced upon us.~
@3247 = ~But people who died are real. And the fact that I keep thinking of your siblings as gaming dice doesn't make it any better.~
@3248 = ~I, too, feel it. Feeling guilty that I do not feel guilty.~
@3249 = ~Maybe we should try to forget it together?~
@3250 = ~You can be very cynical sometimes.~
@3251 = ~It's just typical: evil guys do their evil thing, and we are left to deal with the consequences.~
@3252 = ~No, it doesn't.~
@3253 = ~Precisely. And I wonder what I should do.~
@3254 = ~If you'd like to. Some guilty love amidst the ruins - but it is better than grieving on our own.~
@3255 = ~I suppose it comes with the profession. Too often I have seen what the others think - literally. But... I do feel sorrow.~
@3256 = ~(Xan smiles a little.) This is so like you, <CHARNAME>. Armed and armored in questionable wit.~
@3257 = ~If you want, we can share a reverie tonight. Walk the halls of Candlekeep with me. Or we could close our eyes, join hands and sail to the Green Isle.~
@3258 = ~And hope that those who died in Saradush, too, found a better place.~
@3259 = ~No. A definite ''no" to cutting my hear, dyeing my nails pink, replacing my spellbook with pictures of naked dryads or trying to get me a tattoo. Did I cover all the list?~
@3260 = ~The bit about naked dryads was interesting.~
@3261 = ~A portion of it.~
@3262 = ~Hey, I simply offered to cut your hair!~
@3263 = ~You need to loosen up.~
@3264 = ~What can I say? One of your companions liked to draw.~
@3265 = ~I do not feel comfortable around change, melamin. Pranks or no, I am used to my looks, and if years of wandering haven't changed them, I doubt much else will.~
@3266 = ~"Pranks or no"? I sense a story here.~
@3267 = ~Have you always been looking like you do now?~
@3268 = ~I can live with the way you look right now. Just wanted to spice you up a little.~
@3269 = ~Why don't you like change?~
@3270 = ~And thank the Seldarine you warned me first. Had I woken up with a tattooed Slayer on my forehead, I might have well had a heart attack.~
@3271 = ~I am an enchanter, so, as you probably guess, my appearance is used for more than vanity. It is a tool, one I use to probe minds, inflict emotions... dominate, sometimes.~
@3272 = ~I have to visualize my own image constantly as I cast. Should it change rapidly, my magic is all but useless for a while.~
@3273 = ~Of course, every aspiring mage in Evereska knows all this. Changing a rival's appearance is still popular among students. (sigh) As you can guess, it happened to me once.~
@3274 = ~I hoped to escape it in the Academy, but I was wrong. In my second year I was deemed too 'serious' by two young men of questionable character, and as such, my fate was sealed.~
@3275 = ~One morning, I was walking down a corridor to my next class when the world around me simply vanished. It lasted only a minute, or so I thought, but when the color came back, something was very wrong.~
@3276 = ~Laugh or not, but as the nearest mirror was eager to show, I became a very distinguished-looking albino.~
@3277 = ~Did it last long?~
@3278 = ~Who did this to you? Did you have your revenge?~
@3279 = ~And you were unable to cast magic?~
@3280 = ~Oh, Xan...~
@3281 = ~(laugh) Sorry, couldn't help myself.~
@3282 = ~I... did, as a matter of fact. Not as satisfying as I hoped, but it had to do.~
@3283 = ~(Xan gives you a look, but sighs and says nothing.)~
@3284 = ~The enchantment proved impossible to dispel, so I had to endure it for another tenday. And another, until I realized the problem was literally in my own hair: my attackers left a cursed needle glued to my ear, covered by a lock.~
@3285 = ~I removed the curse, and that was that. I passed the year with honors: even those who laughed at my appearance in the corridors treated me with respect.~
@3286 = ~But I could not forget that sense of helplessness, and a burning desire to hide somewhere - or wear a hood at all times. So... no, <CHARNAME>. I would like to leave my hair as it is.~
@3287 = ~I understand.~
@3288 = ~What of those pranksters, then? Did you meet again?~
@3289 = ~You must have been too sensitive for your own good.~
@3290 = ~Too true. Indeed, a rare enchanter is not. But a calm veneer is something we are taught later. Although in that, I am sorry to say, I have never been a very good student.~
@3291 = ~Years later, already a moonblade wielder, I travelled to Waterdeep with my superiors. They had an entourage of young elves with them - adventurers, youths eager to see the world - all sorts.~
@3292 = ~Those two pranksters were with them. Well, they were respectable mages, of course. And it so happened that I still had that pin... a very easily breakable-in-two pin, in fact...~
@3293 = ~Xan! You didn't!~
@3294 = ~I thought you'd cut their hair.~
@3295 = ~Wasn't it beneath you?~
@3296 = ~Serves them right.~
@3297 = ~Oh, I did. And proud of it.~
@3298 = ~Believe me, I could have - but one of them was an enchanter, and it would have cost him dearly.~
@3299 = ~Perhaps. But I could not help myself.~
@3300 = ~At least they were smarter than a younger me: the effects disappeared as we entered the outskirts of Waterdeep. Although I hear one of the Masked Lords is suffering from a very particular ailment now...~
@3301 = ~But I've taken too long of your time with a simple story. Just... don't pick up any strange needles anywhere.~
@3302 = ~Magic can be unreliable, it's true. But it is nearly all I have. I cannot very well be a pure swordsman, as you well know.~
@3303 = ~No? You could be a brilliant one.~
@3304 = ~How about a disciple of Corellon Larethian? You worship him, don't you?~
@3305 = ~You could be anyone, Xan. A bard, a druid, a shadow dancer - you only need to want to.~
@3306 = ~It *is* dangerous. I'm just concerned, it's all.~
@3307 = ~Tell it to the last fiend I tried to impress with my fencing skills. He was amused, as I recall.~
@3308 = ~I do. But worship and serving as a priest are two different things. And wouldn't you be jealous, if you became a goddess, and I served another?~
@3309 = ~An assassin, you mean? (sigh) Given the nature of our tasks, I most certainly am one already.~
@3310 = ~If you are concerned about dangers of being a mage, my mind is well-protected. I was practically born an enchanter, given the length of my training.~
@3311 = ~My will is mine. No demons from the Outer Planes will come through. I will not go insane, and should my age and health demand it, or should the need come to pass, I am ready to abandon my spells entirely, if need be. After all, a senile archmage is a danger to everyone.~
@3312 = ~But everything bad ALWAYS happens to mages! Netheril, Thay, Irenicus - they are practically magnets for disaster!~
@3313 = ~That's a relief. I certainly don't want to find imps in my bed and cook cambions for breakfast.~
@3314 = ~But think of how useful you'd be in combat with those Deathbringer assaults...~
@3315 = ~You never wanted to practice laying spike traps just a tiny bit?~
@3316 = ~Our doom tends to be closer, true, but... Wait, am I reassuring you? When did the world turn upside down?~
@3317 = ~Oh, given the places we travel to, you certainly will be. I am surprised you haven't, yet.~
@3318 = ~I think you spend *far* too much time with Sarevok.~
@3319 = ~And lose both my arms in the process? No, thank you.~
@3320 = ~You are right to worry, however. The Weave may become our doom, as it already has, more than once. You remember the story of Karsus as well as I do; Irenicus just repeated his feat in Suldanessellar in lesser measure.~
@3321 = ~And Helm, foolish enough to kill the goddess of magic during the Time of Troubles... truly, a great brain never rested in that pot-head of his.~
@3322 = ~But even so, we'll persevere. Do you know the main secret of magic?~
@3323 = ~No! Do tell.~
@3324 = ~Don't I know it already?~
@3325 = ~Of course I do. Mystra's power lies in her Chosen.~
@3326 = ~What are you talking about?~
@3327 = ~Magic will never die. Mystra's power over the Weave may fade, but the Lady does not wield her entire power herself. Much of it is hidden in Azuth, and much - in her Chosen. Which is, incidentally, why Elminster is so interested in you: naturally, since he is a half-god himself.~
@3328 = ~Even if another Karsus is born, and another tries to usurp the Weave's powers, it will never be truly gone. And you've seen where such folly leads, anyway.~
@3329 = ~I'd like to prevent it, in any case.~
@3330 = ~To our deaths, most likely.~
@3331 = ~Nowhere pleasant.~
@3332 = ~And that, I can safely say, is a doomed endeavor.~
@3333 = ~And I'd be inclined to agree, but knowing you? You'll survive even if the world itself will be torn in two.~
@3334 = ~Truer words were never spoken.~
@3335 = ~We may certainly perish. But an adventurer of our caliber never just dies. He is vanquished by his enemies, his doom, his own writing on the wall. Knowing us, we'll die from a well-aimed curse, but survive if an entire plane collapses around us. This is simply how things are.~
@3336 = ~That said, we probably should go. I am sure our doom is already expecting us in a ditch somewhere.~
@3337 = ~If you wish it.~
@3338 = ~There lived a young elven girl in a tower by the sea. She wanted to see the world, but her family wouldn't let her.~
@3339 = ~However, she had a great argument in her favor - she was a seer. So, since she *saw* herself seeing the world, her parents had no choice but to let her go as soon as she was able to fend for herself.~
@3340 = ~She left the green Isle of Evermeet and came to the human lands to seek her fortune. She helped others, using her gift, but more often leaning on her own intuition: magic was no reason to do something you didn't like, she said, and made her own fortune, having become a capable mage.~
@3341 = ~Yet both her gift and intuition led her to danger: she helped a beggar who was secretly involved in slave trade. He called for his men, and the elven girl was taken to a dirty warehouse and left there with other would-be slaves, waiting for a ship that would take them to the strange land of Calimshan.~
@3342 = ~Fortune smiled on her, however. A young elven swordsman who swore to defend his people in need had long been searching for the same slave traders: they made a mistake of kidnapping some of his elven kin.~
@3343 = ~And he was a fearsome foe. For he, too, had a gift of foresight, and it led the young swordsman to the warehouse without delay. Alone, he managed to kill the guards and free their captives - his elven kinsmen and the elven girl among them.~
@3344 = ~His job done, he turned to go. But the girl called to him, angrily.~
@3345 = ~"What about other slavers?" she said. "And other elves who would come into this city and be captured or slain?"~
@3346 = ~Surprised, and a little intrigued, the young swordsman turned to her, and together, they worked out a plan. With the help of the former slaves and several honest city guardsmen, they rooted out corruption from the city guard, and raided all slaver lairs within the city, including the sewers. You can imagine what they smelled like by the end... but the deed was done, for the best of all.~
@3347 = ~New captain of the guard made sure that slavers and their ilk stayed well outside the city walls. And thus, trade in living souls was eradicated from Waterdeep, although not from the Undermountain beneath it.~
@3348 = ~And also... it was how my parents met.~
@3349 = ~So the girl was your mother, and the young swordsman - your father?~
@3350 = ~It was a lovely story.~
@3351 = ~Will you tell me more about them?~
@3352 = ~Indeed. My telling does not do the story justice, but I tried my best.~
@3353 = ~I would tell you more, but it is a painful subject: of their passing you already know. Perhaps they will join each other in the Blessed Realm... but while my blade lives, it is not to be.~
@3354 = ~Another? <CHARNAME>, I am not a bard, you know this.~
@3355 = ~But very well.~
@3356 = ~Once, on a morning so early that stars still shone in the west, my father took me for a walk. We talked on the way, but about simple things, like weather, food, my studies, or repairs in the villa.~
@3357 = ~Yet when we came to our favourite haunt - a cliff facing Anauroch, my father fell silent. He stared into the horizon for a long time, and then asked me if I wanted to know more about his blade.~
@3358 = ~Of course I leapt at the chance. The child in me yearned for a bright, irresistible toy sheathed on my father's hip. The would-be adventurer in me was already dancing in the circle of orcs, cutting them down one by one. And the young man in me was dreaming of... well, you can imagine.~
@3359 = ~A harem of <CHARNAME>s?~
@3360 = ~Me? Memememe!~
@3361 = ~Girls?~
@3362 = ~Not boys, I hope.~
@3363 = ~(Xan gives you a Look.) <CHARNAME>...~
@3364 = ~(He smiles.) Of course. Even if I did not know you then.~
@3365 = ~And thus, my fate was sealed. Of course, I heard none of my father's warnings about the blade. He was somber then, and kind, and the words he uttered on that morning are now so close to my heart it aches. But back then I knew nothing, and understood less.~
@3366 = ~I wanted to be a hero to my people. To do something. To mean something. To be respected by all elves from all tribes and to be recognized as... someone special.~
@3367 = ~But I am growing older, and I want to be free. I often think: what if I heard my father then, buried my pride, and left the blade for someone more worthy?~
@3368 = ~You were only a child.~
@3369 = ~It was your duty to be your father's heir. Your fate would have remained the same.~
@3370 = ~We would have likely never met.~
@3371 = ~What did your father tell you?~
@3372 = ~My best consolation... Thank you, <CHARNAME>.~
@3373 = ~But the thought remains: I should have known better.~
@3374 = ~Yes. And no. I will never know now.~
@3375 = ~On that morning, my father told me the same things I told you back on the road to Baldur's Gate. That the moonblade kills those unworthy to wield it. That drawing the sword is dangerous, and being apart from it is fatal. That my father would never join his loved ones in Arvandor, unless the sword became dormant. That... that my own mother... would not see him...~
@3376 = ~(Xan's voice drops to a whisper.)~
@3377 = ~That I might never see you...~
@3378 = ~(sigh) Regardless, you know all this. And, heedlessly, I still claimed the blade.~
@3379 = ~And, strangely, I am reluctant to part with it. For if I ever do, unlikely as it seems - what is to become of me? Who will I become? An elf with a moonblade - without a moonblade?~
@3380 = ~What about me? A Bhaalspawn who will no longer be a Bhaalspawn.~
@3381 = ~You will pull through.~
@3382 = ~You are much more than an elf with a moonblade, you know this.~
@3383 = ~MY elf without a moonblade, if you please.~
@3384 = ~Will we pull through if we both lose a piece of our hearts, do you think?~
@3385 = ~There are women in Arvandor right now, waiting for their beloved ones. And I - carrying their spirits on my belt, like a fallen sorcerer. And yet it is the will of Corellon and a ray of light on this plane. My father's symbol of pride - and a key to who I am.~
@3386 = ~(sigh) When did the world become so complicated?~
@3387 = ~I am sorry, melamin. I... might be out of stories for a while.~
@3388 = ~I really wouldn't...~
@3389 = ~(sigh) Oh, <CHARNAME>, for the Seldarine's sake, don't make these eyes. I cannot resist this face of yours, you know this.~
@3390 = ~Very well, then. A happy ending, this time?~
@3391 = ~Would be good.~
@3392 = ~A bittersweet one, rather.~
@3393 = ~Nah, let everyone die.~
@3394 = ~And here I was hoping for sunshine and rainbows. Very well, then, let the massacre begin.~
@3395 = ~I could never understand that metaphor. Bitter and sweet? A piece of cake soaked in tears?~
@3396 = ~Not the best of desserts, if you ask me.~
@3397 = ~I told you about a young elven swordsman - my father, and how he met a beautiful young mage from Evermeet - my mother. But they did not fall in love and get married at once.~
@3398 = ~After their adventure in Waterdeep, they went separate ways. My mother decided to learn more from her kin and enrolled into the Academy of Magic in Evereska.~
@3399 = ~Not a year after her arrival, a strange happenstance occurred: the best students started getting assassinated in their rooms. My mother, being a diviner of no small caliber, foresaw two such attacks, but she could not pinpoint the source.~
@3400 = ~Yet it did not stop her. As the attacks became more frequent and students started leaving the Academy, she traced a light magical trail from the latest assassination to the office of the High Mages.~
@3401 = ~The High Mages were involved?~
@3402 = ~Why would someone want to kill students?~
@3403 = ~What did she do?~
@3404 = ~My mother found out that the chambers in question belonged to an old archmage, Vaenon. She took to scrying, and learnt a simple, horrible truth.~
@3405 = ~Vaenon was secretly hoping to remain on the Prime Material Plane after his death, and since lichdom was not appealing to him, he tried to replace a talented young man's spirit with his own, getting a new body in the process. Yet his experiments failed - all his subjects died.~
@3406 = ~A hothead that she was, my mother angrily confronted Vaenon. The High Mage waved her off and imprisoned her mind with a Domination spell - he did not deem a woman's body worthy of inhabiting, and he needed a spy in the Academy.~
@3407 = ~In the meantime, the young swordsman - my father - had a dream in the High Forest about a girl he met not long ago being held captive by a dark figure.~
@3408 = ~With speed that surprised himself, my father mounted the fastest horse and rode towards the city. He entered my mother's chambers in the Academy in a dead run - and stopped with a knife brushed his neck.~
@3409 = ~The enchantment Vaenon placed on my mother was working - and she was commanded to bring my father to the corrupted archmage. He needed someone "of strong blood", Vaenon said, and a young man from a family of moonblade wielders was an ideal victim.~
@3410 = ~What happened?~
@3411 = ~Did she do it?~
@3412 = ~Let me guess. Your father said something that made her drop the knife?~
@3413 = ~I... I do not know what they said to each other in her chambers back then, her knife to his throat. They would not tell, and I only asked once. But both said they had visions of that moment before, even if they did not understand it, and it helped them to find a path to each other.~
@3414 = ~My mother's will was strengthened by my father's presence, and eventually her hand shook and the knife fell - she would not kill the man she came to love. She broke the enchantment, and together they confronted Vaenon.~
@3415 = ~The most improbable thing is, they won: perhaps he was weakened with many failed attempts to find another body for his spirit, or my father's anger and my mother's will proved to be too much for him... I do not know.~
@3416 = ~But they won, and they were married soon after, and never separated since. There, I suppose, goes the happy ending... although you know what happened later.~
@3417 = ~(Xan sighs, falling silent.) A long story... but perhaps they will get another happy ending, yet. Do you think we'll get ours, <CHARNAME>? After Irenicus, Sarevok, the Five and Corellon knows what else? You and me?~
@3418 = ~No promises. But it might just be possible.~
@3419 = ~I hope so.~
@3420 = ~We? We are doomed.~
@3421 = ~I am sorry, Xan, but our chances are slim.~
@3422 = ~Where there is a choice, there is always a chance, my father said once. Like many other fathers tell their children, I suppose. Like, perhaps, Gorion told you.~
@3423 = ~And there is hope. Remember what I said when we survived in the graveyard? We have the rest of our lives.~
@3424 = ~I never thought the feeling could be lasting. But I pray it will be.~
@3425 = ~Come. Let us write our own story for a change.~
@3426 = ~In any other world, perhaps. In another world, they'd likely insist on educating elven and kobold children together. Or be disgusted that an elf would not want to bond herself to a human man of waning years, to have her heart broken in two decades.~
@3427 = ~Or forbid communion for elves, since gnomes cannot share memories and dreams the same way. Or force us to give up a part of Evereska to an orc tribe. Or... but I will leave the rest to your imagination, if you do not mind.~
@3428 = ~Understandably, I doubt it would be any better.~
@3429 = ~It would be a disaster.~
@3430 = ~A perfectly lovely picture of hell, yeah.~
@3431 = ~But don't elves bring it on yourselves? Haughty, aloof and all that?~
@3432 = ~Would you love me if I were a gnome? Or a human?~
@3433 = ~You know what I mean. Not all elves treat other races the same.~
@3434 = ~(Xan gives you a small smile.) I'm afraid so. We've literally been through hell together. <CHARNAME>, at this point we'd be so close I doubt your race would've changed much.~
@3435 = ~... If you asked the question yourself first after all these years of friendship, of course. I would have never dared impose.~
@3436 = ~I had a friend, once, kin of my mother from the Isle of Evermeet. He disappeared from my horizon long ago, but even today, I remember his face clearly.~
@3437 = ~A druid who watched borderline forests being destroyed by human settlements, he believed in elven supremacy with all his heart. I doubt a human ever heard a kind word from him, but he healed wounded trees, led animals to safety, and helped those who got lost or ambushed in his forest, albeit with little gentleness.~
@3438 = ~So... whoever said my kin was aloof and haughty was correct, just as I would hardly join in a friendly conversation with random inhabitants of Gullykin or Athkatla. But he was kind, and left this world a better place. And even if he had done nothing good and noble, but hurt no one, I would still take his side over anyone else's.~
@3439 = ~These are our lives, and our choices. Frankly, I would rather condemn the would-be equalists out there. But I prefer not to care overmuch for such things. Do you?~
@3440 = ~Now that you mention it, I think not.~
@3441 = ~I do, I think. I want everyone to like me.~
@3442 = ~Of course I care! Someone out there is wrong!~
@3443 = ~Ah, it's hopeless, anyway.~
@3444 = ~Good. Let them live in their world, and let us remain in ours.~
@3445 = ~And it is only natural. But would you want them in your life? In ours?~
@3446 = ~And this is a just cause for a crusade, I see. But perhaps it can wait till dinner?~
@3447 = ~The single, absolute, veritable truth.~
@3448 = ~The world is what it is. Half-drow are outcasts everywhere, orcs are hunted, drow are hated, and elven cities are closed to outsiders.~
@3449 = ~Sometimes I wonder what it would be like if things were different and I was raised in human lands instead of Evereska, but I love my city and my people, and there is no other world for me. Is there one for you?~
@3450 = ~No, I guess not.~
@3451 = ~Perhaps in the future.~
@3452 = ~This world may well change, Xan.~
@3453 = ~There is, actually.~
@3454 = ~Then you are a visionary, melamin. One who is far more optimistic than I.~
@3455 = ~The future... who can tell?~
@3456 = ~But it is time to go. We should concern ourselves with people that need saving from the Five, elves or no. And if they are not very happy about it - well, neither, I should add, am I, for it is hardly worth the effort of trying.~
@3457 = ~But we try anyway.~
@3458 = ~And you are mine. I am curious - did you have a best friend growing up?~
@3459 = ~No, I was alone.~
@3460 = ~Imoen, of course.~
@3461 = ~A kid in Candlekeep. It's the past now.~
@3462 = ~I only had Gorion.~
@3463 = ~It does not matter.~
@3464 = ~I see. It is good you had someone, then.~
@3465 = ~And you could do much worse. Sarevok did.~
@3466 = ~Of course. I am glad you had each other.~
@3467 = ~As I suspected. I was much the same, as you can guess.~
@3468 = ~When I was a child, I sometimes dreamt of imaginary friends. Not that any would appear, of course, so I soon deemed it a hopeless endeavor.~
@3469 = ~Later I had teachers and allies and, perhaps, even companions, but no one as close as family. Not until I journeyed to Nashkel.~
@3470 = ~These moments, when we sit side by side by the fire, or fight yet another impossible cadre of monsters, or exchange drinks and stories... it is camaraderie I have never known.~
@3471 = ~And I have you to thank for it. My friend. Mellonamin. A star truly shines on the hour of our meeting.~
@3472 = ~A star? I'll settle for nothing less than a double display of fireworks!~
@3473 = ~Now that you mention it, how about a drink?~
@3474 = ~It's been good.~
@3475 = ~And you'll have them. But when the dazzling clouds are gone, a star remains.~
@3476 = ~If you wish. As long as THAT night in the Copper Coronet with Korgan and Hendak singing together does not repeat itself, I suppose.~
@3477 = ~I'd like for us never to part. But if we do - what if we choose a constellation on the night sky, and think of each other as we look at it? Many elven couples do this - and friends do, too.~
@3478 = ~I'd like that.~
@3479 = ~No, I do not think so.~
@3480 = ~Very well. But when I look at the starry sky, I will always think of you.~
@3481 = ~There is Corellian - the autumn constellation. Each year, as the summer ends, we gather in the temple of Corellon... I hope to bring you there one day.~
@3482 = ~The Galleon Nebula, blown by the celestial winds... The Brow Star, the northern in the Circle of Mystra - they call her Alagairtha in the sands of Anauroch, a breathtakingly beautiful and proud sorceress who opposed the gods. Imprisoned in the heavens, she will never walk the Realms again... and somehow, she reminds me of you. Mystra's Star...~
@3483 = ~There are so many, and so beautiful, with legends to match. I cannot choose. But when I look at the starry sky, I will always think of you.~
@3484 = ~And I - of you.~
@3485 = ~Seconded.~
@3486 = ~Of a breathtakingly beautiful me, remember.~
@3487 = ~Naturally. But do keep away from the gods: you never know when they are about to freeze you inside a burning star.~
@3488 = ~Let it be our talisman, then.~
@3489 = ~You are my best friend, <CHARNAME>, and always will be. Let us go - and let the star that shone on the hour of our meeting never fade.~
@3490 = ~Thank the Seldarine... but we can never thank them enough. And thank you - over and over again.~
@3491 = ~So, we know the truth now. And it doesn't change anything, does it?~
@3492 = ~Well, I'd still rather Corellon just came to us and plain out said it.~
@3493 = ~I am glad that we finally know, at least.~
@3494 = ~Without those dreams, you may have been alone now. And me, lost somewhere within my blade - or wandering the forests of Arvandor.~
@3495 = ~I will pray to the First of the Seldarine tonight. There are... words that need to be said. Although most of all, I live thanks to you.~
@3496 = ~Perhaps we'll celebrate the day each year? With songs, dance, a small feast for the closest of friends? I used to play the lute a little - I could recall it for the occasion.~
@3497 = ~You played the lute a little?~
@3498 = ~Sounds good to me!~
@3499 = ~We could give it a try, I suppose.~
@3500 = ~I would much rather forget that day.~
@3501 = ~I understand, melamin. Sometimes I see it in reverie, each time hoping it is the last. Bodhi's face... my own horror... No, it is best it lies forgotten.~
@3502 = ~Only a little - it was when I was learning to draw. I liked how the simplest of melodies ran smoothly, like water. But then my magical studies started, and I had time for little else.~
@3503 = ~But when all of this is over, we could have a private celebration, just for you and me, being alive. Will you have it?~
@3504 = ~If you bring the lute.~
@3505 = ~Why not? It could be fun.~
@3506 = ~Do you have anything *special* planned for the occasion?~
@3507 = ~I am not in the mood to discuss selebrations right now, to be honest. I am tired.~
@3508 = ~So that I could serenade you first? It would be a rather poor attempt, so be warned. But I will try my best.~
@3509 = ~(sigh) That is, if I can find the esteemed instrument.~
@3510 = ~Believe me, I do. Starting with a thorough massage and a long, relaxing bath... and all sorts of other things.~
@3511 = ~We could rest now, if you like. Just give the order.~
@3512 = ~And thank you again for telling me.~
@3513 = ~It is settled, then. We are alive - and when it is over, we will celebrate in each other's arms.~
@3514 = ~But what matters is that we are together. Tonight, tomorrow... and for many days after.~
@3515 = ~What? Ah, that one. It's not worth your attention, <CHARNAME>. Besides, it healed already.~
@3516 = ~I see that. But where did you get it?~
@3517 = ~You do not want to tell me?~
@3518 = ~Still, I am curious.~
@3519 = ~Never mind, then.~
@3520 = ~No... you deserve to know.~
@3521 = ~(sigh) I hoped you wouldn't notice, but of course you did. Or, should I say, your fingers did? But very well.~
@3522 = ~It was a duel.~
@3523 = ~What?~
@3524 = ~WHAT? And you didn't call me?~
@3525 = ~Fascinating! You killed your opponent, I hope?~
@3526 = ~It happened back in Suldanessellar. You were still asleep - unconscious - after our journey to the Abyss, if you remember.~
@3527 = ~I woke up a few days earlier and went for a short walk - cold as it may seem, I knew when you were about to wake up, and did not want to disturb you before. You needed rest. ~
@3528 = ~But you were there when I woke up.~
@3529 = ~But the duel?~
@3530 = ~And you met your opponent?~
@3531 = ~What happened then?~
@3532 = ~Of course, melamin. And never was my heart gladdened so. But on that hour, alas, I was not at your side.~
@3533 = ~I stood by a balcony, looking at the view. There was much destruction, but homes were intact, tree branches still wove their green melody, and a bird flew overhead. And you were alive. I was standing their with my eyes half-lidded, so very close to happiness.~
@3534 = ~Suddenly, I was rudely woken by a sharp voice over my shoulder. One of Elhan's soldiers stood there. By a look of him, he was a hardened veteran, and a captain, to boot.~
@3535 = ~He ordered me to leave. I'll skip some of the epithets he called us, but he was unhappy about a Bhaalspawn in the palace. Very much so. Enough that he wanted his men to enter the palace, drag you along the streets and throw us out of the city.~
@3536 = ~I mentioned that we were his Queen's guests - he did not care. The dirt he spouted... Frankly, for a moment I wanted to take you in my arms and carry you out of that blight of a city - forever. But you were fragile, and the man was a lout.~
@3537 = ~Yet several people stopped to listen, and two were nodding. So I could not let it continue. I challenged him.~
@3538 = ~But did you kill him?~
@3539 = ~You could have killed him outright.~
@3540 = ~But he was a solder. And you are... not the best in fencing.~
@3541 = ~In hindsight, I think a silence spell would have worked much better. But back then I wasn't thinking - I just knew I would do anything not to let the likes of him into the palace. Anything.~
@3542 = ~So, a pair of soldiers were drafted as our seconds, and we were in position before I realized it. I was standing there clumsily with my blade sheathed... Stupid dictates of honor: he was a deadly foe, and I could not use magic. (sigh) But no matter now.~
@3543 = ~He attacked with such ferocity I barely had time to dodge. Again he lunged, and I received a glancing blow - that was the scar you saw last night. So I finally drew my sword.~
@3544 = ~And the rest is history. Upon seeing my moonblade, he dropped his weapon and admitted he was wrong; so did several others. I did not know what to say - forgive him? Ask if he still wanted to throw us out? He didn't - I saw it in his eyes.~
@3545 = ~So I simply turned to go. It was a little difficult to breathe, but Demin healed my wound in the palace, and I never mentioned the incident to the others. And then you opened your eyes.~
@3546 = ~But you did not tell me!~
@3547 = ~I am glad you are all right.~
@3548 = ~Next time, just fix it with a well-aimed Finger of Death.~
@3549 = ~(Hug him)~
@3550 = ~It was nothing substantial to speak of, as you see now. But it is good you know. I would rather not keep any secrets from you.~
@3551 = ~Although... I still have one. And you will never guess it no matter how hard you try.~
@3552 = ~Let me guess: you love me.~
@3553 = ~And in Elvish this secret would be - "Amin mela lle"?~
@3554 = ~I love you, too, Xan.~
@3555 = ~Oh, trust me, I intend to use a holding spell, at least. (sigh) But it is hopeless.~
@3556 = ~(Xan silently returns your embrace.)~
@3557 = ~It was the happiest day of my life when you opened your eyes in the royal palace of Suldanessellar. And another when we escaped certain death at Bodhi's graveyard. Yet another - now, when I stand by your side, and you smile at me - like so.~
@3558 = ~Never mind the scar, melamin. We have each other.~
@3559 = ~Suldanessellar. The day when you woke up, after you regained your spirit. Do you remember?~
@3560 = ~I was so happy then...~
@3561 = ~I am smiling here. Do I smile like that?~
@3562 = ~There is wind in my hair... Was it on one of the talans?~
@3563 = ~Of course. I became whole again.~
@3564 = ~I kept asking you how you felt, and you just laughed and tossed your hair - and your eyes shone brighter than a full moon.~
@3565 = ~We never went indoors - and people were celebrating on the talans of Suldanessellar. Even the wounded, even Elhan's grim warriors, even the Queen... although she was sad, too. Sad and regal.~
@3566 = ~(sigh) And guilty, for much of it was her fault, and I would not blame those who said so openly, for I was one of them. But enough of her. There was you. There is you.~
@3567 = ~How do you feel right now? You look beautiful, but what of your spirit?~
@3568 = ~Just like I felt in Suldanessellar - wonderful.~
@3569 = ~I am fine, Xan. Stop worrying.~
@3570 = ~I do not know what the future will bring, and it concerns me.~
@3571 = ~I am well, but for how long?~
@3572 = ~Let's not think of it now. Let me look at you, instead.~
@3573 = ~I remember drawing your image in broad strokes - quickly, because I wanted to capture your smile, your hair, the light in your eyes. The sun shone so brightly - the entire moment is a pinpoint in my mind, so sharp that the heart sill aches when I think of it.~
@3574 = ~It is strange how I always think of mortality in my happiest moments. Of tragedy. "It is good, therefore it is finite", or so the saying goes. Perhaps it is simply my nature. I just... keep hoping against hope it is not a vision of things to come.~
@3575 = ~We won. We are together. No Irenicus will steal my spirit again.~
@3576 = ~Even if it is, we will fight it together, and banish it.~
@3577 = ~Why can't you ever envision cake? Or kittens?~
@3578 = ~Because it will no longer be me? Although, come to think of it, a piece of chocolate cake won't go amiss right now. I love your chocolate kisses, you know.~
@3579 = ~But... yes. You are right. I look at you, and I see you at your best - powerful, young, radiant. One of the People. And I believe we will get through anything.~
@3580 = ~And in darker times, I will look at the drawing of you and remind myself that miracles are possible.~
@3581 = ~With you? <CHARNAME>, you don't know yourself. You would challenge the Abyss itself if you were bored. Although *that* would lead us to the kingdom of the dead for sure.~
@3582 = ~I grow tired of constant danger, it is true. Seeking stolen moments with you, dreaming of a peaceful home in the valley of dreams, where a sunset never dies - it is a part of it. But peace is not all I seek.~
@3583 = ~What do you seek, then?~
@3584 = ~What are you dreaming of?~
@3585 = ~I wouldn't want just to live quietly somewhere. I want action!~
@3586 = ~We haven't seen so much yet. Watching the snow falling around us, walking on the beach just to see sunrise, not monsters... visiting cities in the sky, or underwater - although we covered that, in part.~
@3587 = ~And, of course, my old neverending dream: uncovering secrets of true High Magic, beholding the Planes for the first time, entering the Blessed Realm with you.~
@3588 = ~Never will our adventures truly be over. Although I welcome serenity, in a way, I, too, have a restless spirit - and chaining it even to the most beautiful of landscapes does not suit my passion.~
@3589 = ~Good to hear it.~
@3590 = ~Some peace would be nice, though.~
@3591 = ~There is a large world out there. I look forward to exploring it.~
@3592 = ~I like the word "passion". We can build on that.~
@3593 = ~But we have to deal with this crisis first. And if we do end up in the kingdom of the dead - why, I believe you'll simply loot the first tomb in sight, challenge its guardian, and our crusade will begin anew. Am I right?~
@3594 = ~Well... sort of.~
@3595 = ~More likely, Solar would find us there and talk my head off.~
@3596 = ~Always, dear.~
@3597 = ~Me? I'd only loot bare essentials.~
@3598 = ~Nope! Wrong and wrong again.~
@3599 = ~In other words, everything that can be sold for at least one gold piece. (sigh) And you'll probably find a merchant, too.~
@3600 = ~(groan) Do not remind me. Heavens, can't we find any peace from the woman?~
@3601 = ~I promise you one thing: if we ever find ourselves too bored and complacent, I will follow you into any adventure just to change the mood.~
@3602 = ~...Seldarine, did I truly just say that?~
@3603 = ~Then it will naturally happen, and it is pointless to hope otherwise.~
@3604 = ~You're calm.~
@3605 = ~You've never dwelled on it?~
@3606 = ~I cannot sleep sometimes. What if something will happen to you? To me? To our friends?~
@3607 = ~We'll deal with it the way we always have - we'll save others, lead people to safety, and look after our own. And then, once safely away - panic.~
@3608 = ~(Xan smiles.) We are doomed, but at least there is a measure of irony in that: even among the worst cataclysms, there will always be a lost child you'll save and someone's useless heirloom you'll bring back to their owner - even if only for the coin and thrill of adventure.~
@3609 = ~But, truly, if you think panicking beforehand will do us any good, tell me. I will happily join you.~
@3610 = ~All right. Let's panic together! Someone, bring the wine!~
@3611 = ~Just promise me we'll be all right.~
@3612 = ~Nah. Waste of time, really.~
@3613 = ~We'll be all right, <CHARNAME>. Somehow, I know we will.~
@3614 = ~Naturally. Now that we're epic heroes and *still* cannot afford a horse, do you think I'll be content for us to travel thousands of miles by foot? Not in this lifetime.~
@3615 = ~Aww, you care about my feet! That's nice.~
@3616 = ~Well, when will this teleporting stuff be ready, then? I want to go to Thay!~
@3617 = ~Are you sure that's all you're researching?~
@3618 = ~(sigh) Seldarine, I forgot how literal you sometimes can be. No, <CHARNAME>, we're not going to Thay today or tomorrow, and I can't convey how happy it makes me.~
@3619 = ~No... not all. But it is not ready yet, in either case.~
@3620 = ~It is all preliminary, you understand. I am no Joneleth, so it will take me months to become proficient in teleporting around, and by then our journey to the Throne of Bhaal will be long over; perhaps I'll be dead. But since there is always a slim chance, I decided to invest some time in it.~
@3621 = ~Although... You've probably already guessed: saving time is not the main reason.~
@3622 = ~There is a chance your divine destiny will catch up with you. I... I don't want that. I will miss you every hour of every day, and I hope with the hope of a damned man that it never happens.~
@3623 = ~But it may. And I want to find you if it does.~
@3624 = ~You want to find me if I become a goddess? Truly?~
@3625 = ~Great! We'll meet in Sigil and go for an ale!~
@3626 = ~Why? I could simply summon you, no?~
@3627 = ~(sigh) <CHARNAME>, truly... must everything be a joke?~
@3628 = ~Was there ever any doubt?~
@3629 = ~I know you'll be much more powerful than me, enough to summon me at your whim, but... sometimes things do not work this way, otherwise Cyric would have brought you and Sarevok to his throne room long ago.~
@3630 = ~So I want to be sure. (sigh) Although, of course, there's always a possibility of failing.~
@3631 = ~And if you stay - well. There is so much more to the world that we haven't seen: a different blue to every spring, falling leaves in Evereska, magical clouds over Anauroch... new places and journeys.~
@3632 = ~And running away from enemies! Yay!~
@3633 = ~I would like that.~
@3634 = ~I'd take that portal to Evereska with you.~
@3635 = ~You're too pessimistic. OF COURSE I'LL STAY WITH YOU, YOU MORON!~
@3636 = ~<CHARNAME>, if you *still* expect me to stop expecting the worst, you might have just as well bonded Jan Jansen.~
@3637 = ~...Oh, gods. Seldarine, let me unsee that. Please.~
@3638 = ~Ah. That. (sigh) Of course. However could I forget?~
@3639 = ~I am almost certain that one day we'll open a portal to Evereska, light a candle and thank Corellon we got there in one piece. But for the time being - the roads beckon.~
@3640 = ~To the road, then.~
@3641 = ~Let me just unroll the map...~
@3642 = ~I am looking forward to the day.~
@3643 = ~(groan) Seldarine, why do these backpacks have to be so heavy?~
@3644 = ~I think I'll double my research time tonight.~
@3645 = ~I do, strangely enough. Other Xans... It doesn't sound normal, does it?~
@3646 = ~It does to me.~
@3647 = ~I think of other <CHARNAME>s frequently, myself.~
@3648 = ~Just an idea I had.~
@3649 = ~So many opportunities... Imagine if I was born in Candlekeep and grew up as your childhood friend? Or in Luskan slums, becoming a hedge wizard for the evil Arcane Brotherhood - and a soon-to-be escapee, probably. Or in some land where magic was not and has never been an option - who would I have become?~
@3650 = ~An orphan, a mercenary, a High Mage... So many roads.~
@3651 = ~But then I would never witness my father's death, never draw my blade, become a Greycloak and defend my people... meet you. And those events made me who I am - without them, other "Xans" would not be "Xans" anymore.~
@3652 = ~Perhaps you are right.~
@3653 = ~I think I will always be <CHARNAME>, regardless of circumstances.~
@3654 = ~I would've loved to live through those other lifetimes with you.~
@3655 = ~Well, I just hope every Xan out there found his <CHARNAME>. It would be lonely otherwise.~
@3656 = ~Absolutely. They would all be doomed.~
@3657 = ~Their lives would be so hollow...~
@3658 = ~Hardly worth the effort of trying, truly.~
@3659 = ~Very.~
@3660 = ~You think so?~
@3661 = ~One just needs to lay eyes upon you, <CHARNAME>. And then, all resistance is futile.~
@3662 = ~There is one thing, yes. I regret not buying a pancake.~
@3663 = ~You... regret not buying a pancake?~
@3664 = ~This one I have to hear.~
@3665 = ~Ahem. Was tortured here!~
@3666 = ~And I wanted to bring a smile on your face. Listen.~
@3667 = ~There was a stall in Baldur's Gate, not far from the city entrance, and they made thin pancakes - crepes, really.~
@3668 = ~I never tried them, but the smell was overpowering. Delightful, with a hint of butter. Each time we passed the Elfsong, I swore I'd buy some for us, but we always had one urgent task or another.~
@3669 = ~Finally, we were off to Candlekeep. The journey promised to be a short one, so I sighed inwardly and decided to spend my hard-looted money later.~
@3670 = ~And then... we found out you were a Daughter of Bhaal. I forgot all about pancakes, as you can imagine. ~
@3671 = ~When we're back in Baldur's Gate, I am buying you one. Or several.~
@3672 = ~Maybe if you had a few, you'd feel much less doomed.~
@3673 = ~You brought a smile on my face. Thanks.~
@3674 = ~I would like that. Perhaps the stall is still there, after all...~
@3675 = ~There is so much we cannot change. Irenicus, Khalid's senseless death, destruction in Suldanessellar... It was not in our power. Although had I known, I would have taken you to Evereska - and to the Abyss with the consequences.~
@3676 = ~But there are little things that can change the fate of one day, one hour, and it is foolish to deny ourselves that. Don't you think?~
@3677 = ~I fully agree. Hey, we can make pancakes for breakfast!~
@3678 = ~Maybe. But sometimes you need to save someone's life, not dwell on food.~
@3679 = ~No. We have DUTY. And responsibility. So there!~
@3680 = ~I am glad you finally realized it.~
@3681 = ~Pancakes for breakfast we're having, then. Now, where to find some leavening...~
@3682 = ~True enough. Still, if we ever are in Baldur's Gate, I am treating you to some crepes. Or, perhaps, a quiet dinner in the Elfsong instead?~
@3683 = ~And I. But let us go, melamin. We have a dream to fulfill, do we not?~
@3684 = ~Relieved?~
@3685 = ~Told you I was going to stay.~
@3686 = ~What are we going to do now?~
@3687 = ~Oh, very much so. Enormously so, in fact. I don't think there is an adjective adequate for the occasion.~ [O#XAN312]
@3688 = ~And I believed you. But, like I said before - if you expected me to stop worrying, you'd be better off bonding Coran or Tiax. Or Angelo Dosan. Hmm. There's a sight I'd like to unsee...~ [O#XAN313]
@3689 = ~Now I just want to rest. No ruminations, no visions, no prophecies - only blissful sleep.~ [O#XAN314]
@3690 = ~And in the morning - we'll see. Now we have the entire world - and the rest of our lives beckon, don't you think?~ [O#XAN315]
@3691 = ~But Solar awaits you. Go, melamin. Shape your destiny at last. And I will always be here when you need me.~ [O#XAN316]
@3692 = ~Irenicus is in my party. Stranger than strange, don't you think?~
@3693 = ~Irenicus isn't evil anymore. Am I that good, or am I that good?~
@3694 = ~That was my line, <CHARNAME>. But... yes. Most definitely.~
@3695 = ~You know, I keep expecting him to take one of the challenge rooms for his... experiments. Are you sure he won't do that?~
@3696 = ~I'm not sure of anything, these days.~
@3697 = ~I am actually trying to redeem him. I hoped you'd understand.~
@3698 = ~If it helps us all, why not?~
@3699 = ~If he tries, he dies. End of story.~
@3700 = ~Decisive as always. Or is it callous? I can never decide.~
@3701 = ~Just hearing you say that sends chills all over my body. Have you ever considered that it's still *you* he wants to see on the operating table?~
@3702 = ~I do understand. Heavens, Corellon Larethian himself would probably understand, were he here - and far be it from me to doubt Ilmater's mercy.~
@3703 = ~I just wonder if you fully understand yourself. He was your enemy and soul-wielder, after all.~
@3704 = ~Do you have a motivation? For him to stay with you - with us, I mean. It is your own business entirely, and I can't say I do not sympathize. But I would like to know.~
@3705 = ~A part of me wants him to suffer. But he is capable of redemption, Xan. Everyone is.~
@3706 = ~Perhaps it is our soul bond, but I feel a lost brother in him. A friend.~
@3707 = ~Mercy. I still think it's my main reason.~
@3708 = ~He intrigues me. Captivates me. Challenges me. If things were different...~
@3709 = ~I can change him. I know I can.~
@3710 = ~If Sarevok, why not him? I'd take Bodhi, too. Or not.~
@3711 = ~We lack real evil in our party, I think.~
@3712 = ~Curiosity, mainly. I couldn't pass such an opportunity by.~ 
@3713 = ~He is a VERY powerful mage. Can you count his Horrid Wiltings?~ 
@3714 = ~Are you kidding? He is practically my slave now!~ 
@3715 = ~I want him to suffer. And I will have a real revenge for what happened to me.~
@3716 = ~He must understand the pain he caused - and feel the guilt and the shame of it.~
@3717 = ~My motivation is my own.~
@3718 = ~I do not want to talk about it.~ 
@3719 = ~I am tempted to say "I will believe it when I see it", but you are right, of course. Of course...~
@3720 = ~I doubt he sees such in you, so be careful. But perhaps you'll gain his trust yet - or already have.~
@3721 = ~And the best reason, if impartial. But can you stay objective?~
@3722 = ~He might have ended as your friend - or your leader and mentor, perhaps. Or an ally. A partner in crime, a fellow demigod? Or perhaps more than that... I see.~
@3723 = ~Yet your former adversary may have his own goals. And he may feel no less certain.~
@3724 = ~(sigh) I think I'll not comment on this particular motivation, if you don't mind.~
@3725 = ~Power, curiosity, interest, research... do you know which word I am going to say next?~
@3726 = ~Experiments.~
@3727 = ~Are you sure you are not better than that? I tend to think you are.~
@3728 = ~(sigh) Must he? Yes. But will he?~
@3729 = ~Yet you started the conversation. But very well. Just know I am on your side.~
@3730 = ~His was a cruel punishment - not unjust, but too cruel. Unworthy of the Seldarine's finest. I regret his suffering, although my anger with his methods will never fade, even if your scars do.~
@3731 = ~Your presence is a powerful one, and you may well steer him - Joneleth - towards a path of your choosing. Yet... it is a narrow line, and both your fates hang in the balance. And your journey is far from over.~
@3732 = ~Just... be careful, for all our sakes.~
@3733 = ~Careful. If he hears you, he'll revert back just out of spite.~
@3734 = ~Why don't you two talk more, by the way?~
@3735 = ~No congratulations, then?~
@3736 = ~Let's hope not. Besides, I think his conversion is genuine.~
@3737 = ~(sigh) I am rather wary of him, still. And he - he enjoys the attention, but I doubt he truly needs company. You are an exception of sorts for our Joneleth, I suppose.~
@3738 = ~You have done a great thing. A true change. Maybe the gods will give him a second chance, after all.~
@3739 = ~I hope so, too.~ 
@3740 = ~And a new face, preferably. I'm getting tired of the mask.~
@3741 = ~It's a pity I'll never get as much as a "thank you" from him.~
@3742 = ~He will thank you eventually, you know. Maybe not aloud, but... you did save him, only a fool would not understand that. And he is no fool.~
@3743 = ~I only hope the change will last. His pride is still strong, for one. But his future road, I suspect, is another story entirely.~
@3744 = ~See, they like me in Evereska, after all. I even got a cloak!~
@3745 = ~(A breathless man approaches you in a run, and you recognize Ricar, an elf you met in Elhan's camp.)~ [O#XAN000]
@3746 = ~Xan! I found you at last... thank the Seldarine...~
@3747 = ~You're alive, then? I searched for you after the battle in Suldanessellar, but you were nowhere to be found.~
@3748 = ~Yes, but... it's a long story. After we learnt the truth about Hunrae and her "Eilistraee" followers, Elhan thought it was unwise for me to remain close to the Underdark any longer. I regained some of his trust by battling the drow in the tunnels... but not enough, it seems.~
@3749 = ~But pardon me. <CHARNAME>, I am very pleased to see that your soul has been restored. I hope you are well?~
@3750 = ~Saving the world, as usual.~
@3751 = ~I am, yes. But you did not approach us to exchange pleasantries, right?~
@3752 = ~Relatively. Why are you here?~
@3753 = ~Me? I am doomed. Haven't you heard? Half of Tethyr is hunting me. I'm hunting the other half.~
@3754 = ~So I heard. You are ever the center of attention, these days.~
@3755 = ~I bring you some news. But do not fear: the tiding are better than you might have hoped.~
@3756 = ~News? For me or for <CHARNAME>?~
@3757 = ~For both of you, I would think. Unless I missed something, any news that concern either of you would immediately affect the other, no?~
@3758 = ~The main bit of news concerns you, but it is important for the Child of Bhaal, as well.~
@3759 = ~As I said before, Elhan sent me away from Suldanessellar. I was to act as diplomatic envoy to Evereska, to deliver the news of the Shattered One's passing and ask for assistance in rebuilding the city. The documents also mentioned that one of Evereska's own aided Suldanessellar's defenses greatly, and so did his companion, a Child of Bhaal called <CHARNAME>.~
@3760 = ~Indeed, the Queen herself wrote the passages about you and your companions in most moving terms - a great honor, especially given...~
@3761 = ~Given <CHARNAME>'s heritage, you mean to say?~
@3762 = ~I do. And would you blame me, seeing what Yaga-Shura's armies had done in Saradush?~
@3763 = ~Xan, I understand you received a letter from Eragrim in Evereska. Your mentor sent it shortly after you reported Bodhi's death and your mission's success to him - the coven in Athkatla was no more.~
@3764 = ~Ah, *that* letter. "Leave the infamous Child of Bhaal to <PRO_HISHER> doom, come home, have a cookie?" Indeed, I've almost forgotten - thank you for the reminder.~
@3765 = ~Well, it needn't concern you any longer. Eragrim was mistaken in his assessment - he said so himself. And here is another letter from him, composed after he read of the events in Suldanessellar.~
@3766 = ~Let me see...~
@3767 = ~Oh. He doesn't seem to think that <CHARNAME> is evil incarnate anymore. And he even trusts my judgment. "If you see a way to avoid the bloodshed... remain by the Child's side... might have been mistaken..." Do my eyes deceive me?~
@3768 = ~Xan, here is a letter from your mentor, Eragrim, in Evereska. He composed it after he read of the events in Suldanessellar.~
@3769 = ~Indeed? Curious: I haven't heard from him since I told him I bonded a daughter of Bhaal. Let me see...~
@3770 = ~Oh. He doesn't seem to think that <CHARNAME> is evil incarnate anymore. And he even trusts my judgment. "If you see a way to avoid the bloodshed... might have been mistaken... should this carnage be over, we must talk about you both returning to Evereska..." Do my eyes deceive me?~
@3771 = ~The High Council does not fully approve of all <CHARNAME>'s actions, naturally - unwillingly or no, your companion has become a part of the emerging chaos that threatens to devour Tethyr and the Sword Coast. But <PRO_HESHE> has done much to quell the fires in Suldanessellar, and now, I hear, Yaga-Shura lies dead, slain by <PRO_HISHER> hand.~
@3772 = ~So, the Council would like you to stay by <CHARNAME>'s side and finish your task.~
@3773 = ~(sigh) Exactly what I was doing, in case they hadn't noticed.~
@3774 = ~And one more thing: I understand that while in Evereska, you brought the designs to the Academy and asked Eragrim to make a copy of the famous Balduran's cloak.~
@3775 = ~Well, the work is finished, and the cloak is yours. I hope it helps in your coming trials.~
@3776 = ~Thank you, Ricar. Have a safe journey back.~
@3777 = ~Is this all? Maybe there's a pair of magical boots to go with it?~
@3778 = ~Finally, something useful! Oh, look at the time. Now we REALLY have to go.~
@3779 = ~So, they order Xan to stay by my side and bring me a magical cloak? Not exactly urgent news.~
@3780 = ~You know, "You are good guys. Here, have a cloak", would have sufficed.~
@3781 = ~Phew. Next time, talk without me. I think my ears are about to fall off.~
@3782 = ~This is all I have for you, I fear. I made haste because Eragrim looked... well... rather tired and guilty, to tell you the truth, and he asked me to get the letter to you as soon as possible.~
@3783 = ~I... understand. Thank you, Ricar. It is... a relief. I will write to him soon.~
@3784 = ~Farewell, Xan. And all the best to you, <CHARNAME>.~
@3785 = ~I feel we're missing Minsc's pet hamster's line somewhere here.~
@3786 = ~*squeak!*~ [GAM_48]
@3787 = ~And here we are. The stuff of legends, right, Boo?~
@3788 = ~But it is time for us to move on. Lead the way, <CHARNAME>. And thank you.~
@3789 = ~(sigh) You don't know half of it, <CHARNAME>. The High Council may approve helping you now, but should you win? In the best case, there will be endless deliberations. In the worst case, they'll deny you entrance to Evereska just in case.~
@3790 = ~They don't hate me. I'll take what I can get.~
@3791 = ~At least they don't want you to abandon the vile Child of Bhaal at once.~
@3792 = ~Ah, I don't care. I got the cloak!~
@3793 = ~You are not vile, <CHARNAME>, and never have been. Impulsive, maybe. A little mad, sometimes - certainly each time you see a dragon's hoard. Reckless? Ten times so. But vile? Not from where I stand - and I should say I know you quite well by this point.~
@3794 = ~Maybe you are right. I sometimes with I had your approach to life. And the cloak... (cough) Sorry, don't mind the last phrase. Although it looks very fine, come to think of it. Reminds me of that cloak-and-helm adventure we had in the upper district of Baldur's Gate. Who would have thought the nobles protected their houses with Helmed Horrors?~
@3795 = ~At any rate, I am glad Eragrim saw sense and approved of me helping you. He is a good man, a good mentor. I miss his company.~
@3796 = ~Was he like a father to you?~
@3797 = ~Tell me about him.~
@3798 = ~I am glad it put your mind at ease.~
@3799 = ~Him? Oh, no. A kind but grumpy old uncle, maybe. He is very wise, though. You know, the kind of wisdom that stares you in the face but you never recognize it until life shoves it down your throat? That kind.~
@3800 = ~He helped my mother a lot after my father died, for one thing. She couldn't do basic tasks: walk around the house, eat, sleep. I helped her, but it was as if she didn't see me... Eragrim gave her back the sight. Not for long, for she passed away in the end, but... it brought us hope.~
@3801 = ~(sigh) It was hard, not to have a kind word from my home. Eragrim's letter helped a lot. And I am glad I am staying by your side. If there is one constant thing in my life these days, besides danger and crazy adventures - it is your presence.~
@3802 = ~My beautiful and charming presence. Honestly, you should've memorized the words by now.~
@3803 = ~You're the best thing that happened to me.~
@3804 = ~We're in this together, Xan. I will always have your back.~
@3805 = ~Don't forget camaraderie, adventure and steel on steel!~
@3806 = ~'Crazy' adventures? Look who was going to defeat Bodhi's coven on his own.~
@3807 = ~Oh, indeed? And were I instead to say "your amazing and wonderful presence"? What horrors would you have unleashed, I wonder, hmm? Perhaps we will find out this very night?~
@3808 = ~And you - to me. Not just a 'thing'. A miracle.~
@3809 = ~I was perfectly safe, let me point out - until, of course, I met you in the Government District. Guess what happened then? Pirates, bandits, drow, golems, rakshasa - and, yes, vampires.~
@3810 = ~I hope Ricar is welcomed back in Suldanessellar. And that each and every one of us is welcomed back home. Somewhere.~
@3811 = ~Will we welcome each other home, do you think? I will dream of the day tonight. And of you.~
@3812 = ~And one more thing: I understand that in your previous letter you sent Eragrim designs for an advanced Cloak of Protection.~
@3813 = ~(As you get ready to rest, you notice Xan sitting huddled near a small campfire. His shadow dances across the floor, as flame tongues challenge each other.)~ [O#XAN000]
@3814 = ~(Approach him)~
@3815 = ~(Go to sleep)~
@3816 = ~(As your eyes start to close, you think you see a cloud of white flowers dancing over the flame. But it is probably just a trick of light.)~
@3817 = ~Sweet dreams, then. And should you encounter any nightmares, send them here.~
@3818 = ~(Xan gestures to his sword.) I've got a blade with their name on it.~
@3819 = ~(Your footsteps are light, but Xan raises his head at once.)~
@3820 = ~Hey. I... do not feel I am ready to rest, yet. Sit with me?~
@3821 = ~All right.~
@3822 = ~No, I'm off to bed.~
@3823 = ~It's been an eventful day, hasn't it - with Gorion's wraith and all? My own ghosts...~
@3824 = ~Yes. Yes, it was.~
@3825 = ~Just the usual.~
@3826 = ~Do you want to talk about it?~
@3827 = ~About the false ghosts of my sires? No. No, I do not want to relive it again and... well. You know.~
@3828 = ~I look at the fire, small pieces of ash carried by the currents of air, and think of Evereska. Well, I am always thinking of Evereska, but it is more specific this time.~
@3829 = ~Cherry blossoms. When spring gives way to summer, it rains white all over the valley. Mirtul... remember the flowering in Baldur's Gate, near the Hall of Wonders? We went there together. Khalid was alive... I wish we saw more of him. I never knew...~
@3830 = ~(sigh) And here my mind wanders to sadness and death again. Forgive me, love. Here... let me change the subject.~
@3831 = ~(He touches your hair.) Remember how we sat near the fire in the early days? Me braiding your hair, you looking at the stars?~
@3832 = ~I do. And I love that we still look at the stars - together.~
@3833 = ~You didn't actually braid my hair. You retreated into the shadows muttering that it was our last night in this world and everything was hopeless, if you recall.~
@3834 = ~Why, Xan, are you thinking of braiding my hair again?~
@3835 = ~Very much so. You have beautiful hair, you know this.~
@3836 = ~Luridel should be bright tonight... pity we missed the time. Do you know that the Philosopher's star is actually a planet? A gas giant of greenish-blue, populated by avians. The sunrise must be spectacular: thousands of birds bathing in the light...~
@3837 = ~No wonder Elminster is rumored to have a resort there. Hmm, what do you say to claiming an island or two for ourselves?~
@3838 = ~And driving out Elminster? Count me in!~
@3839 = ~Good idea.~
@3840 = ~On a gas giant? I don't know, Xan...~
@3841 = ~Well, the idea is just one of many. We can go to Evereska and watch cherry blossoms falling, or step through a planar portal - and where will we end up then? Somewhere wondrous, I'd hope, but knowing you, "dark and dangerous" is far more like it.~
@3842 = ~And speaking of looking at the stars and braiding your hair...~
@3843 = ~And *you* are too cruel to just forget that embarrassing moment, I see. I am half-tempted to pounce for a tickling attack, you know.~
@3844 = ~You, pouncing? Not in this lifetime!~
@3845 = ~Pfft!~
@3846 = ~Indeed? I'd like to see that.~
@3847 = ~(Pounce on Xan first)~
@3848 = ~Now, the idea of a tickling attack sounds *very* tempting right about this minute, but I am going to decline. Here is a much more enticing prospect...~
@3849 = ~Ah! Mercy, oh Great Bhaalspawn! Or, on the other hand...~
@3850 = ~(With a flick of his hand, Xan creates two bright soap bubbles that envelop your hands for a minute, not letting your fingers out.)~
@3851 = ~Would you let me braid your hair again? I swear, in the firelight it looks as if it is made out of gold, silk and sparking water.~
@3852 = ~All right, then. All yours!~
@3853 = ~Be my guest.~
@3854 = ~Let's simply sit near the fire.~
@3855 = ~(Xan quickly unclasps pins and binds, letting your hair flow free around your face. This time he does not construct elaborate braids, but instead simply takes out a wooden brush and starts working on the tangles, very gently, until your hair starts shining brighter than the brush's glittering handle.)~
@3856 = ~(Finally, he wraps your hair into a single loose braid. You don't know how he does it, but there is a garland of cherry blossoms woven into the texture, and a delicate wreath adorns your brow.)~
@3857 = ~And here we are. Sleepy yet?~
@3858 = ~A bit. Shall we rest?~
@3859 = ~Not really. Let us sit some more.~
@3860 = ~Just let me do one thing first.~
@3861 = ~(He whispers a spell, and a fresh breeze sings back - somewhere above you a window opens, and a shower of cherry blossoms fills the air, glittering in the firelight like fresh snow.)~
@3862 = ~(Xan puts one arm around your shoulders, and together you watch cherry blossoms dancing over the fire, as invisible wind slowly guides them far, far away, to the land of no snow and sorrows.)~
@3863 = ~(There is a chill in the air tonight. Xan sits on the bedroll, his hair loose upon his shoulders, his battle garb discarded nearby. He gives you a rare smile as you approach.)~ [O#XAN000]
@3864 = ~Ah, we are not resting in your pocket plane this time. That's a relief. I was getting a little tired of all the demon arms and disembodied voices.~
@3865 = ~I much prefer the outdoors, too.~
@3866 = ~Really? I'd say you've grown pretty comfortable there with me... at night.~
@3867 = ~Well, feel free to tell me your thoughts after we are ambushed on this very spot.~
@3868 = ~I much prefer normal beds, but one cannot be picky, I suppose. Especially if one is allowed to gaze upon your perfect form each night. Or... more than gaze?~
@3869 = ~Well, when you put it this way, a "no" is out of the question, isn't it? Especially since our last night in that green-hued place was rather... memorable.~
@3870 = ~Careful what you ask for. I may well do that - and you'll be stuck with me for the rest of the night. Although you'll be with me for the rest of the night anyway, it seems...~
@3871 = ~I am glad we set camp a little away from the others. I have a rather improper question for you.~
@3872 = ~We are bonded - what question could be improper?~
@3873 = ~What is it?~
@3874 = ~I think I just want to sleep. It's cold here, anyway.~
@3875 = ~Yes, about that...~
@3876 = ~For the oddest reason, I cannot light even a small fire tonight - either I am out of spells, or just too tired. Probably the latter: enchantment and invocation never went hand in hand. And my pride makes me rather reluctant to ask someone else.~
@3877 = ~So, what shall we do? Retreat to the pocket plane, where it's warmer, move our bedrolls to the main campfire and break our privacy and the vestiges of my self-esteem to pieces, or -~
@3878 = ~Or?..~
@3879 = ~Warm ourselves up?~
@3880 = ~(Without answering, Xan leans forward and draws you to him with a kiss, his arms warm through a thin shirt, and his lips hot on your skin.)~
@3881 = ~Or we can revel in each other's warmth here, just the two of us. And I cannot say I do not like the prospect.~
@3882 = ~It sounds enticing to me.~
@3883 = ~Ah, but I know so very little about the... prospect. Tell me more.~
@3884 = ~Perhaps another time, but not tonight.~
@3885 = ~Then I wish you a very good night. Here, take an extra blanket - and if you believe my shoulder can make a good pillow, you are welcome to try it at any time. Rest well, love.~
@3886 = ~I want to watch you as you take off your clothes. Or, better yet, I want to undress you myself. I want to feel you naked next to me. I want to make love to you like nobody ever did and no one ever will. And there will be no cold between us - there will be no cold at all. Stay.~
@3887 = ~I will.~
@3888 = ~Like nobody ever did, hmm? Show me.~
@3889 = ~I love it when you talk dirty.~
@3890 = ~Shame on you, sir, you are making me blush! But however can I refuse?~
@3891 = ~It sounds lovely, but - no.~
@3892 = ~Remember our small private celebrations, away from the others - a luxurious bath after Bodhi's ambush, or a sunny room behind light curtains and open windows in Suldanessellar, where the words we say are for our ears alone? But tonight - tonight I feel like I want all the world to hear us, to watch us, to whirl around us.~
@3893 = ~Actually, the idea kind of turns me on.~
@3894 = ~Nope. You are mine. And this is private.~
@3895 = ~I know what you mean. But I like it just the way it is: only you and me.~
@3896 = ~And here I am, suddenly changing my mind. Off to bed.~
@3897 = ~(Xan's eyes are alight with wicked humor.) Then... shall we?~
@3898 = ~Very well, then. Now, what dark pleasures do you have in mind?~
@3899 = ~And so do I. You and me...~
@3900 = ~I wish I could put a "do not disturb" sign in the sky in letters of fire... gods, if only I could. Alas, it feels like there's no magic in me. But never mind. We'll just have to improvise.~
@3901 = ~And we will.~
@3902 = ~Kiss me.~
@3903 = ~Xan? Shut up, already.~
@3904 = ~(And then there is only his warmth and darkness.)~
@3905 = ~(Xan looks thoughtful tonight, but not in a sad way. Indead, he looks as if he has an idea of an adventure on his mind, if it is at all possible with him.)~ [O#XAN000]
@3906 = ~Are you sure? It's a once-in-an-epic-quest opportunity, you know. We'll always be too busy afterwards, and hoping for a second chance is ever a doomed endeavor.~
@3907 = ~All right, then. I'm in.~
@3908 = ~Nope. Still against it.~
@3909 = ~If you wish it. Keep me company for a while? I like to fall into reverie next to you.~
@3910 = ~<CHARNAME>, we are going on a boat ride tonight.~
@3911 = ~Oh, are we?~
@3912 = ~On a sand boat, perhaps? Or a dungeon boat?~
@3913 = ~I don't see a boat here, though.~
@3914 = ~Meaning wet hair and a ruined dress? Not a chance.~
@3915 = ~We definitely are.~
@3916 = ~There is no actual boat, I fear - not here, at least. Here: my hand will do.~
@3917 = ~And wherever shall your memory take us?~
@3918 = ~Just a sharing of dreams? How about journeying to the Lake of Steam?~
@3919 = ~All right. What now?~
@3920 = ~Well, if the Five kindly give you leave, I do not see why not. Unfortunately, they do not seem to be in a giving mood.~
@3921 = ~It is not a trip down the memory lane this time, so be prepared for actual water, waves and even an occasional splash. Are you ready?~
@3922 = ~Are you joking? Of course I am!~
@3923 = ~But where are we going?~
@3924 = ~Mmm... I think not.~
@3925 = ~You'll see everything in a moment. Just hold tight.~
@3926 = ~Here we are. I know you've seen the Watcher's Keep from all possible angles, but not like this - not as a carefree traveler who comes to enjoy the sky and the Sea of Swords in her lover's company.~ [O#XAN000]
@3927 = ~I wish I could open a portal and take you anywhere in the world, but this is just a one-time artifact that takes us there and back, and it only lasts an hour. So let us not waste time. Here, take these candles. If we are about to travel by boat, let us make the journey romantic.~
@3928 = ~I like the sound of that.~
@3929 = ~What do you have in mind?~
@3930 = ~The waters are still tonight. As if they were waiting for our inevitable visit to happen... and somehow, I am glad of it. I want to be with you in this boat, <CHARNAME>. Hold your hands, kiss your lips... and be ever the romantic fool I dreamed of in my early youth. When the world is coming to an end, only fools are wise.~
@3931 = ~Do you think the world is coming to an end?~
@3932 = ~I do not think you are a fool.~
@3933 = ~Let us light the candles, then.~
@3934 = ~In a very certain way, it does. You know what I am speaking of.~
@3935 = ~But I do, melamin. Here I stand with the most beautiful woman of all, and instead of drinking in her fragrance, I bemoan the approaching end of our current journey.~
@3936 = ~In a moment. There is something I want to say goodbye to, although this farewell is premature. But whenever else will we get the time?~
@3937 = ~Our world, which was created by the flowering meadows along the Cloudpeaks, the Nashkel mines, the Underdark caves and your pocket plane - it will be gone when the essence of your dead father lies at your feet. However you choose then, <CHARNAME> the Bhaalspawn shall be no more.~
@3938 = ~We'll build a new world, if you stay by my side. But our memories will remain fresh and poignant, won't they?~
@3939 = ~Let's light the candles, then. One for our meeting in the mines of Nashkel. One for my joy as we stepped outside. One for your graceful hand as you slipped it into mine for the very first time. One for the night when we fell into reverie together...~
@3940 = ~...One for the tale of your moonblade and your doom.~
@3941 = ~...One for the first taste of your lips on mine. And it wasn't sausage!~
@3942 = ~...One for those who died by our hand. Bandits or no, I feel sorry for them.~
@3943 = ~...One for Khalid, a true friend. And Dynaheir, a proud witch of Rashemen. And others.~
@3944 = ~...One for the awesome way we kicked Nimbul's butt!~
@3945 = ~You continue.~
@3946 = ~...One for the day when you decided staying with me was worth it.~
@3947 = ~...One for all the future kisses to come, sausage or no.~
@3948 = ~...One for each soul we saved or helped. And there were a lot of those, melamin.~
@3949 = ~(choke) <CHARNAME>, when they discover my cold and dead body, you will most certainly be the cause of my death, do you know this?~
@3950 = ~One for our bond and our first night together. One for the celebrations in the Ducal Palace. One for our meeting in Athkatla. One for your indomitable spirit. One for your smile in the depths of the Underdark. One for Suldanessellar. One for Bodhi's ambush and our survival. One for you.~
@3951 = ~And one for you.~
@3952 = ~I swear, Xan of Evereska, if you have any more candles, you better dump them in the water now and kiss me, finally!~
@3953 = ~And the last candle goes to us! Let's get into the boat now.~
@3954 = ~(Instead of guiding you to the boat, Xan sweeps you off your feet and boldly steps forward. A lock of his hair falls on your cheek, but instead of brushing it off, he tosses his head and finds your lips in a kiss. You feel the world reel beneath you, and Xan lowers you down against the wood.)~
@3955 = ~(When both of you open your eyes, the world outside changes. In blackness, small fires gleam and beckon all around you, and cicadas chirp from below the autumn trees.)~
@3956 = ~Remember how I once said that you'll never run out of candles with me, Estel'amin? Here we are.~
@3957 = ~You do keep your word, I see.~
@3958 = ~It's beautiful.~
@3959 = ~Aren't you going to kiss me again?~
@3960 = ~(The boat careens again as Xan leans over you, covering your jaw and neckline with kisses. His arms wrap around you, and as the boat glides along in the dark water, bathed in candlelight, you see an unspoken question in his eyes.)~
@3961 = ~(Kiss him)~
@3962 = ~Would you like to make love to me?~
@3963 = ~I like being here with you. Let's just sit together and enjoy the ride.~
@3964 = ~We probably should go back. The artifact won't last forever.~
@3965 = ~(The next kiss is deeper, more insisting, as your clothing falls apart under his caresses, and candlelight shines on your bare skin.)~
@3966 = ~(The waves rock you lightly as Xan lays you down on the pillows, and your naked shoulders touch silk. He runs his fingers up your leg, sending tingles down your skin, and leans over you, shirtless and well-built, every line on his body sharply visible.)~
@3967 = ~You're so beautiful...~
@3968 = ~So are you.~
@3969 = ~And waiting.~
@3970 = ~I'd like to get dressed right now.~
@3971 = ~(The night envelops you two on a small island, lost in the sea of burning candles under an impossibly high sky. Time stops, and only the waves roll beneath you in an ancient rhythm, as you slowly make love.)~
@3972 = ~(Afterwards you lie side by side, the night air cool on your heated bodies, and the last candles flickering around your joined hands like stars.)~
@3973 = ~(Finally, Xan signs, propping himself up on his elbow.) I think my shirt should be here somewhere. Although I am tempted to fling it far into the sea and stay here for the rest of the night. Or forever. Forever sounds fine right about now.~
@3974 = ~(sigh) But, indeed, we should rise and dress, if we do not want to fall asleep here, be carried out to the Sea of Swords and wake up somewhere in the Docks District of Athkatla.~
@3975 = ~Naked.~
@3976 = ~True enough. I don't want to leave, though.~
@3977 = ~Well, what are we waiting for? Rise and shine!~
@3978 = ~(groan) And robbed, probably. But let's not go there.~
@3979 = ~(sigh) One day, one of these days, I am going to hide your clothes somewhere very, very far from the shore. And we'll see what you will do *then*. But your wish is my command, melamin.~
@3980 = ~(Xan kisses your brow.) I'm all yours, melamin.~
@3981 = ~(You sit in comfortable silence, watching the floating candles. One by one, the stars come out, and your own calm reflections in the water look like a tapestry in some heavenly temple. Xan's smiles, looking at you - and Mystra's Star suddenly shines upon your reflection's nose.)~
@3982 = ~(You do not know how long you sit here, but eventually only a few candles are left burning, and a distant wind starts to blow. Xan rises, offering you his arm.)~
@3983 = ~I do not want to go. It is selfish, is it not? But being here with you - it's as if doom was never invented at all.~
@3984 = ~But, indeed, it is time. Do not let go - trust me, ending up halfway between Rashemen and Thesk is not in your best interests. And certainly not in mine.~
@3985 = ~(Your companions are long asleep, but Xan sits alone near the campfire, and an appetizing smell rises from a very tasty-looking tomato-and-cheese omelet on the coals.)~ [O#XAN000]
@3986 = ~Early breakfast?~
@3987 = ~Smells nice.~
@3988 = ~Digging into the party's stores, are we?~
@3989 = ~(Ignore him and go to bed.)~
@3990 = ~(You dream of cheese tonight.)~
@3991 = ~Or late dinner, depending on your tastes.~
@3992 = ~Thanks to the Amkethran market, there's plenty more, and fresh, too. Though how Calishite merchants manage to keep the eggs fresh, I have no idea.~
@3993 = ~Magic takes much of my energy. You haven't noticed it, yourself? After a good battle, one is hungrier than usual. Starving, I would say.~
@3994 = ~And killing Abazigal was no small feat. His attacks were so ferocious... truthfully, I do not understand how we are still alive.~
@3995 = ~And killing Sendai was one of the toughest battles in my life. That, and watching you duel that idiot captain of hers, while I was helpless to do anything.~
@3996 = ~So, to cut a long story short, I felt drained, more than a little tired and in dire need of a home-cooked meal, especially after our dreadful dinner. Besides, you weren't asleep, so I took a wild guess that you'd like to keep me company - and share this omelet. Was I wrong?~
@3997 = ~No, not at all.~
@3998 = ~Let me try the omelet first, and then I'll decide.~
@3999 = ~Shouldn't we wake... wait, there's only enough for two. All right, we don't wake anyone.~
@4000 = ~You haven't told me you were tired.~
@4001 = ~Wait, let me adjust the pan first... here. I like milk omelets a little runny, for some reason. Maybe it comes from the Academy: we had little time to cook and never enough minutes to eat.~
@4002 = ~(sigh) I am tired, <CHARNAME>. You look better than me, but it's the truth: we're running ourselves ragged, and one of these battles will be your last if you do not get enough rest. And, yes, food.~
@4003 = ~I am glad you care.~
@4004 = ~I can take care of myself, Xan.~
@4005 = ~As long as it's yummy food, I've got no objection.~
@4006 = ~It's nice, but I'm not a child and you are not my father. We're equals.~
@4007 = ~You still haven't said why you haven't plain called me and offered to join you.~
@4008 = ~Naturally. Notice how instead of hovering round you in an apron, I quietly cook something appetizing in a corner, luring you out? An element of mystery and a healthy meal in one. See my devious plan? And, unlike my other hopeless endeavors, it does not look doomed yet.~
@4009 = ~And the omelet is served. (sigh) Another minute, and the bottom would be burnt, for my attention was devoured by you utterly. You have the worst influence on me, <CHARNAME>.~
@4010 = ~And yet you are smiling.~
@4011 = ~Mmm! Food!~
@4012 = ~Thank the heavens. I hate runny omelets.~
@4013 = ~And proud of it!~
@4014 = ~How can I not? You are here.~
@4015 = ~See? I learn something new about you every day.~
@4016 = ~You are *insufferable*. And I am proud of it, too.~
@4017 = ~Enjoy your dinner. Or is it breakfast? It probably will be, if we stay up and don't reverie tonight. (sigh) Although recently I sleep almost all the time. The battles take their toll, I suppose.~
@4018 = ~What about you? Do you sleep or reverie these days?~
@4019 = ~I split my nights between both, I guess.~
@4020 = ~I do not want to relive Irenicus or Bodhi or... less pleasant moments. I sleep.~
@4021 = ~I tire, too, so it's sleep all the way for me.~
@4022 = ~I like to reverie. I am an elf, and I enjoy being one.~
@4023 = ~My reveries bring me strength. Besides, I reverie of you.~
@4024 = ~I'd like to join you in reverie on of these days. Perhaps later... if there's any later... no, no, I do not want to think about it. Not tonight. I just wish to look at you, cheese and tomato all over your lips, smile inwardly and think that you are my home. Always.~
@4025 = ~And you are mine. By the way, nice omelet.~
@4026 = ~Keep speaking, and I'll eat *your* portion, too.~
@4027 = ~You just wait. When we beat the Five, I am going to be your palace, castle, kingdom and an island to boot. Maybe a plane, even.~
@4028 = ~Thank you, Xan. I had a lovely meal.~
@4029 = ~(yawn) All right, we ate, now it's time to sleep.~
@4030 = ~It is all for you. Well, besides my not-so-insignificant portion, that is.~
@4031 = ~"And then <CHARNAME> came and ate everything?" Hmm... You know, I think I would rather doom my portion myself.~
@4032 = ~Indeed? Who is going to clean the floors, I wonder? Unless you are comfortable with servants and slaves, I'd settle upon something smaller.~
@4033 = ~Thank you for joining me. And now... (yawn)... how about going to sleep? If we sit here for five more minutes, I fear I will fall headfirst into the pan. And *that* does not tend to do wonders to an enchanter's appearance.~
@4034 = ~Agreed. Come on, then.~
@4035 = ~All right, sleepyhead. I claim your shoulder, though.~
@4036 = ~I thought we'd sit by the fire a little longer. No?~
@4037 = ~Good night, Xan.~
@4038 = ~I am following you, as ever. Let me just clean the dishes... done. (sigh) Ah, the benefits of being an archmage.~
@4039 = ~Left or right? Oh, never mind. You can have both, if you like.~
@4040 = ~Unless the smell of fried enchanter improves your evening, I would not recommend it, melamin. Let us rest.~
@4041 = ~Good night, dear one.~
@4042 = ~And...~
@4043 = ~... If it so happens it is our last omelet together...~
@4044 = ~... Remember that I love you. Always.~
@4045 = ~I want us to be together now, Xan. Please? Pretty please? With a naked Bhaalspawn on top?~
@4046 = ~<CHARNAME>...~ [O#XAN000]
@4047 = ~Don't talk to me about Saradush. Just don't.~
@4048 = ~Is it about Saradush?~
@4049 = ~What is it, Xan?~
@4050 = ~Hmm?~
@4051 = ~I am not going to talk to you about Saradush, no. Or about... other related things you might be thinking of right now.~
@4052 = ~I want to talk to you. Not about Saradush, or the dead, or... my reaction to this horror.~
@4053 = ~For one, we talked about it already. And we will probably keep thinking about it long after the smoke clears.~
@4054 = ~If you want, we will talk about it later. About people we lost, even if we never knew them. But not tonight.~
@4055 = ~I do not think your brain processed it yet. Mine certainly did not. So... I just want to be here for you tonight. Do you want anything? A story, a kiss, a cup of tea, an exchange of words?~
@4056 = ~I think I want all of it.~
@4057 = ~A cup of tea sounds nice.~
@4058 = ~Is it a good story or a bad story?~
@4059 = ~Isn't this conversation an exchange of words?~
@4060 = ~A kiss, naturally.~
@4061 = ~(Xan briefly touches your cheek with his lips. It is not very romantic, but, judging by his pale face and cold hands, he does not feel very well, himself.)~
@4062 = ~(Xan nods, stirring hot water in a cast iron teapot.) I would like one, as well. It is soothing, somehow, isn't it? A familiar routine. Here, take this cup, and I will tell you a story.~
@4063 = ~It is... my story. Which probably tells you everything you need.~
@4064 = ~So it is, my perceptive one. And, given the circumstances, I think it is better than stony silence or silent tears. Don't you?~
@4065 = ~I remember the Time of Troubles, you know. You were sheltered in Candlekeep, but I had to leave my Evereska once. Only once, but it was enough for a lifetime, it seems.~
@4066 = ~I was fortunate in that I never met an avatar of a living god. You'd be surprised to know that on the whole, the roads became safer during that time. Probably due to the fact that divine healing and resurrection ceased working, and even common bandits had some sense of self-preservation.~
@4067 = ~Yet it was a cataclysmic year. Every corner of this god-forsaken - literally - world was being torn apart in some power struggle or other. Those who were not affected hid behind closed shutters in half-abandoned villages... and magic-users were scared most of all, for the Weave ceased to be predictable, and each bard, mage or sorcerer became a whirlwind of wild spell-slinging. Many went insane, too. The rest, like me, had to rely on our weapons and wits.~
@4068 = ~But I was telling you of my own adventure, was I not? Yes, in fact, it happened not far from here. Imagine a small village on the Lake of Steam, a woman giving birth... and two men standing with naked weapons over her unconscious body. (sigh) And my arrival.~
@4069 = ~An intriguing premise. But why were you there at all?~
@4070 = ~Were they all elves?~
@4071 = ~What happened?~
@4072 = ~My mentor, Eragrim, gave me the task, so you can safely assume they were elves. But it was an unusual case. You see, we received news that the woman was about to give birth to a Bhaalspawn, so I travelled there to access the... risks. I did not know what we would do with the child, but obviously giving him or her to the Bhaalspawn cults was not an option.~
@4073 = ~You were about to steal the child from his mother?~
@4074 = ~A Bhaalspawn? Like me?~
@4075 = ~Yes. And no, I did not want to separate them - but I could not refuse this task, because... (sigh) Another Greycloak in my stead would have not hesitated to slay the child, I fear.~
@4076 = ~I arrived at the village, as I said, to find two men standing above the unconscious woman, drenched in her own sweat and blood. Like many in that year, she nearly died without healing and proper care. Thankfully, I had some potions and herbs, and soon she opened her eyes.~
@4077 = ~It turned out that one man was her lawful husband, and another man - her brother. It was very predictable, really: the husband wanted to take his wife and the baby and flee, raise the child in secret so nobody would know - just like Gorion did, it seems. And the brother insisted on waiting for the authorities - for me. Neither seemed able to help the woman they claimed to love.~
@4078 = ~What did you do?~
@4079 = ~What did the woman herself want?~
@4080 = ~I have a sudden new appreciation for Gorion.~
@4081 = ~You will be disappointed with the rest of the tale, I fear. When I asked her, gently, how it happened that she came with child, she cried and confessed: she had a human lover, a ranger from the Northern Tethyr. It was only for one night... but nature, alas, finds a way even when it is not wanted.~
@4082 = ~Scared and remorseful, the woman decided to hide the affair in another lie. Unfortunately, she could not predict that her brother would write to Evereska... and that someone like me would come.~
@4083 = ~But you saved her life.~
@4084 = ~So the child was not a Bhaalspawn, after all.~
@4085 = ~(sigh) She was scared of me, but the baby was born healthy in the end. A perfect half-elven child, and his mother cried in relief... but not her family. Both her husband and her brother abandoned her and returned to Evereska - the city which would never allow a half-elf within its marble walls, unless he is an exalted hero, a prince or a Harper.~
@4086 = ~So ironic: her husband was willing to raise an offspring of an evil god, a product of rape - and turned his back on his wife's one mistake. A cruel mistake, granted, but...~
@4087 = ~(sigh) Sometimes I do not understand the very people I am trying to help. What of you, melamin?~
@4088 = ~I don't know. How about another cup of tea?~
@4089 = ~I think I understand him. I wouldn't want to meet your child from another woman.~
@4090 = ~We are only mortals, Xan. Elves, humans, Bhaalspawn - we all make mistakes.~
@4091 = ~I do not understand it, either. He could have forgiven his wife.~
@4092 = ~True. And we live with our own choices. I just... don't think I could have lived with his.~
@4093 = ~Here. We ran out of plain tea a while ago, so I made you some herbal tea with dried cherries and roselle. It is dark red... reminds me of your lips. I am blatantly banal here, am I?~
@4094 = ~No, I like it. It goes with the tea.~
@4095 = ~A little. Pass me the spoon, please.~
@4096 = ~As long as you keep telling me I'm beautiful, I have no objection.~
@4097 = ~I think you're just asking for a kiss here. (Kiss him)~
@4098 = ~(Xan smiles.) You are incredibly beautiful. And if you look at your own reflection in the cup, you will see it for yourself.~
@4099 = ~Here, I salvaged some chocolate from the store in... (sigh) It does not matter. You do.~
@4100 = ~(His eyes open wide in surprise, but in the next second Xan sets his cup on the floor and you end up in his lap, with his hands in your hair and the faint taste of cherry tea on his breath.)~
@4101 = ~This tea, too, has a story. I heard it is a rare delicacy in the Underdark - and the all-powerful matron mothers pay exuberant prices for the smallest bag.~
@4102 = ~And you can drink it every night. Does it mean you are more powerful than a matron mother, I wonder? Powerful, but compassionate - and so very, very much beloved.~
@4103 = ~<CHARNAME>, <CHARNAME>... Is it wrong to be happy on a night like this?~
@4104 = ~Maybe a little. But it is not wrong to be together.~
@4105 = ~Everyone wants happiness. We just try harder.~
@4106 = ~Not for you and me. We deserve it.~
@4107 = ~We are grieving for Saradush, too, Xan. It is just our way.~
@4108 = ~But are you really happy? Or simply content to sit here with me?~
@4109 = ~(Xan kisses you, drawing you near.) As ever, you are right.~
@4110 = ~So... a story, a cup of tea, a kiss, and an exchange of words. And a long night ahead. Will you tell me a story next? I do not think we will fall asleep easily tonight.~
@4111 = ~All right. Close your eyes, and I will tell you a wonderful story about...~
@4112 = ~Let's just sit together and look at the fire. You and me...~
@4113 = ~We will. Just give me your hand and close your eyes...~
@4114 = ~Shh. No words. Just come here...~
@4115 = ~If you think me a paragon of austerity, <CHARNAME>, you are quite mistaken. And if you think I am resilient to your charms, then doubly so.~
@4116 = ~But? There is a cursed "but" here somewhere, I know it!~
@4117 = ~If you mean that I am not exactly free right now...~
@4118 = ~Then what's the matter?~
@4119 = ~Glad to hear it.~
@4120 = ~Really? That's a new one. I thought you didn't find me attractive.~
@4121 = ~(Xan simply gives you a look.)~
@4122 = ~Our friendship is the matter, mellonamin, and you know it as well as I do. You and I have grown close, slowly, over the course of months and even years, and now I do not have a closer friend than you. If I lose you, I lose everything.~
@4123 = ~So you are afraid.~
@4124 = ~You will not lose me.~
@4125 = ~We already acknowledged our feelings for each other, Xan. A change is inevitable.~
@4126 = ~We are changing... but I want it to come naturally. I want to be able to talk to you about everything, to feel comfort, not anxiety, to let you know that you can rely on me in an hour of need, not for a few hours of passion.~
@4127 = ~You yourself know it very well: anyone who's known you would come to love you. Because you are alluring, and you are attractive - I see it in your eyes, your voice, your soul. Among this whirlwind it is all too easy to lose a friend - and for what? A night that passes, and leaves ashes?~
@4128 = ~Take a breath. Learn of the world around you. Think of what you want. Every great feeling goes through trials - and when friendship turns into love, it has to endure a trial of time. Do you disagree?~
@4129 = ~I don't, Xan. But you and I may die any minute, I may ascend... Is it wrong of me to want you now?~
@4130 = ~You said it yourself - we are doomed. So when to love, if not now?~
@4131 = ~Of course I do! Stupid trials for stupid reasons - kiss me already!~
@4132 = ~I understand your point. I just want more.~
@4133 = ~Would you marry me, if I asked?~
@4134 = ~...~
@4135 = ~Wait, wait. How about at least a kiss first? Then I'll decide.~
@4136 = ~I do not think so, no. At least not right away.~
@4137 = ~Why, yes. I would.~
@4138 = ~(sigh) I have a very strong feeling I am going to regret my words within the next minute. But listen.~
@4139 = ~It is exactly what I am offering you - a future. A future where you can go to Evereska, use my name to open the gates and be a welcome guest... well, as welcome as the High Council can make you feel if pressed against the wall, I believe. And become mine.~
@4140 = ~It is also a chance not to change anything. To remain the best of friends and companions, to travel together, to have me stand at your wedding as a guest of honor, to meet again and again as years go by, to laugh and talk with your husband without a guilty conscience.~
@4141 = ~We are friends, now. If this road is reversed and I have you in my arms - that other road, the one I described just then, can never be.~
@4142 = ~Think of it, <CHARNAME>. And on another thing...~
@4143 = ~We met in the Nashkel mines so long ago, and since then I never stopped thinking how beautiful you were - are - will be a hundred years from this day. We could be bonded by now. Or deeply in love. Yet - we are not.~
@4144 = ~Think on the reason we aren't, and ask yourself if it still stands. Because when we talk about a life together, it means my moonblade, and my doom, and an eternity in the Blessed Realm. Or two broken hearts.~
@4145 = ~I am not the type of person to do things halfway, <CHARNAME>. We will bond - and in a hundred years, if not much, much earlier, one of us will pass away from the Realms. What will the other do, then? Will you start worshipping Corellon and begging for an entrance to Arvandor? Should I change my entire life around to petition your deity? Will we separate for all time?~
@4146 = ~I do not know if you can live with this. I am willing to risk my heart - but won't it break yours? And I would much rather wish you a happy life with another man than see my leader, my friend and the woman I came to admire - broken.~
@4147 = ~Take your time, mellonamin. And if, after months or years, your offer of "pretty please, with a naked Bhaalspawn on top" still stands... Don't even hope for my refusal.~
@4148 = ~Ha! Knew it!~
@4149 = ~I'll hold you to this promise.~
@4150 = ~I need to think about this some more.~
@4151 = ~Whatever you decide, I will always be your friend. This I promise.~
@4152 = ~And now, how about we pretend this conversation never happened and finally see what doom awaits us today? I do not know about you, but I would stake my bets on a horde of beholders. And drow. Probably both. (sigh) Alas, almost certainly with a Bhaalspawn on top, but this time, I fear, it is going to be far, far from naked.~
@4153 = ~(You are getting ready for bed. The room is luxurious: the whole ceiling is mirrored, and an image of you unabashedly stares back as you undress. A door opens and closes, and a lock clicks.)~ [O#XAN000]
@4154 = ~Estel'amin, it is me. Oh. Why is it that each time I see you, I get the strangest feeling you aren't wearing anything?~
@4155 = ~Because I am not wearing anything?~
@4156 = ~It's not far from the truth, seeing how I'm nearly undressed right now.~
@4157 = ~Indeed? Why is that, I wonder?~
@4158 = ~Close your eyes, then.~
@4159 = ~Who can say. Elhan's wise sages, maybe? But certainly not, for I doubt they will ever see this particular sight.~
@4160 = ~I can see that.~
@4161 = ~Would that I could. But the deed is nearly impossible... not with you in front of me.~
@4162 = ~(Xan looks at your reflection in the mirrored ceiling momentarily, then at you.) Seldarine, but I love the view.~
@4163 = ~Do you know that the word "doom" and the word "naked" work very badly together? Indeed, I can hardly use them in the same sentence - not without a smile, and then what sort of doom is that? Not a proper one, certainly.~
@4164 = ~A naked doom?~
@4165 = ~I don't know about that. Your heart could give out in bed, for one.~
@4166 = ~In all these months, has it ever occurred to you *not* to start philosophizing with a barely dressed girl in your room?~
@4167 = ~(Xan smiles.) And it describes you quite well, now that I think of it.~
@4168 = ~(sigh) And here I thought I was usually the one to spoil the mood.~
@4169 = ~Mmm. The idea has merit, I admit. ~
@4170 = ~Do you know why we are here? In this room, at this hour?~
@4171 = ~Because we are tired and it is time to rest?~
@4172 = ~To have some special time together?~
@4173 = ~To treat ourselves to a clean bed, a hot bath, and a clear glass of wine, for one?~
@4174 = ~Because we have no other choice but to be in this place, really.~
@4175 = ~To make love, naturally.~
@4176 = ~Yes, yes, yes and yes. And...~
@4177 = ~(Xan steps closer. He is wearing only a thin tunic and breeches, his own battle garb long discarded.)~
@4178 = ~Do you remember how we celebrated your birthday back in Amn? Well...~
@4179 = ~Don't tell me...~
@4180 = ~Today is your birthday?~
@4181 = ~I remember, yes. Why?~
@4182 = ~Strictly speaking, we didn't, but I know what you mean.~
@4183 = ~Today is mine.~
@4184 = ~<DAYANDMONTH>? I should remember the date.~
@4185 = ~Today is your birthday? Really?~
@4186 = ~Well, what are we waiting for? Let us celebrate right now!~
@4187 = ~And our environs took care of me choosing you a present, too.~
@4188 = ~A-ha! So I can finally spoil your birthday! Push you off the bed, splash you in cold water in the morning or just go to sleep, leaving you aching for me! So many possibilities...~
@4189 = ~That's not fair! I didn't get a large room on MY birthday! I want one!~
@4190 = ~Imagine that. I even feel... joy, or something very much akin to it. In fact...~
@4191 = ~Here is hoping you and I will have many years to etch it in our memories, yet. But just in case we do not...~
@4192 = ~One might even say I have chosen myself a present. But just looking at you here, now - one touch, one memory is worth godhood and a billion stars. And since we are here, and alone...~
@4193 = ~(Xan embraces you, whispering in your ear as his fingers caress your spine.) Evil, evil person. What am I to do with you?~
@4194 = ~Whatever you desire.~
@4195 = ~I do not know. Should I give you ideas?~
@4196 = ~Actually, I think I am going to bed...~
@4197 = ~Alas, the only lodgings I could afford on that day were the shacks near Aran Linvail's headquarters - and they probably weren't for rent, either. But if we are alive for the next celebration, absolutely. We'll sell Cespenar to Queen Ellesime and rent a palace, if we have to. As for now...~
@4198 = ~You... you are?~
@4199 = ~No, silly! Kiss me, already!~
@4200 = ~Well, I might change my mind, yet... If you ask nicely.~
@4201 = ~I am. It's been a heady day.~
@4202 = ~Shall we enjoy ourselves? The night is young, but it passes all too quickly.~
@4203 = ~I would love that.~
@4204 = ~If you take off these clothes, we might.~
@4205 = ~I am rather tired, Xan.~
@4206 = ~Hmm... Yes? No? Maybe? Convince me.~
@4207 = ~Do you think I could find the right words? I am doomed to be awfully ineloquent in times like these, melamin. But...~
@4208 = ~Stay with me tonight. Please. Enjoy this night I have for you.~
@4209 = ~All right...~
@4210 = ~With only one condition: that you enjoy the night *I* have for you.~
@4211 = ~Another night, Xan. I promise.~
@4212 = ~I would like to, but no.~
@4213 = ~(His face uncharacteristically alight with happiness, Xan whirls you around in his arms. You land on the bed, laughing, his face suddenly very close to yours.)~
@4214 = ~I love you. I love you so much...~
@4215 = ~(Xan's reflection leans over yours and kisses you, gently at first, but with growing passion and insistence. His shirt ends up on the floor with the rest of your clothes, and the mirror reflects smooth skin on his back, pale next to your hands, tanned under the Amnish sun.)~
@4216 = ~(The room is brightly lit, and every line of your body is mirrored, every tilt of your head reflected, and your night takes on a dreamlike quality as your eyes are closed and open again and again, and the world outside is lost among kisses and whispers, breathless moans and his hands on your skin.)~
@4217 = ~(Your head finally clears in the bath, the water relaxingly warm. Xan sits on the ledge half-dressed, wet drops glistening on his shoulders.)~
@4218 = ~A glass of wine to celebrate the occasion?~
@4219 = ~Why not?~
@4220 = ~To fall asleep here and now, more like... But all right.~
@4221 = ~No, I'm good.~
@4222 = ~(Xan pours smooth, ruby-red liquid into two glasses and offers one to you.) They call it a gift of one final, perfect summer day. Strangely appropriate, don't you think?~
@4223 = ~There is something else... an illusion, a vision I wanted to show you. It is important to me... but I would not want to impose it on you, if you don't want me to.~
@4224 = ~I want you to. Show me.~
@4225 = ~A vision? Yes, I would like to see it.~
@4226 = ~Hey, you just "imposed" your own sweet company on me, which I quite enjoyed, too, so I wouldn't worry about such trivialities. Out with it!~
@4227 = ~Mercy! Xan, haven't we done enough for one night?~
@4228 = ~I have a strange premonition it will be about doom and death. No, let's go to rest on a happy note.~
@4229 = ~Then look in the mirror. Do not do anything - just look up.~
@4230 = ~(You see nothing but your reflections at first. But suddenly an invisible wave passes through the ceiling. Magic envelops your mirrored twins' figures, and the next moment you are looking at yourself as an image of perfection unobtainable for a mortal, your features both sharp and soft, and your eyes impossibly deep. The beauty you are staring at is divine, and by Xan's sharp intake of breath you begin to understand: it is an image of what could be, if you vanquished your enemies and ascended.)~
@4231 = ~(Xan's reflection changes little, but by the darker shade of his attire and the holy symbol on his breast it seems - you can only guess - that he is the high priest or even the Chosen of the new goddess. A visible change comes over his double's face: it seems older, and the look in his eyes is both hopeful and yearning for something close and yet impossibly far away.)~
@4232 = ~(Then another change ripples through the mirror. When it clears, you see yourselves looking back at yourselves again - now mortal, aging. A road appears before you; then a house; a villa. You see friends and new faces, coming and going. A dragon roars far away; a horn sings triumphantly; bare feet run through a garden. An apprentice takes a stack of scrolls from Xan; you lean over a bed with a candle; a ship sails into the sunrise.)~
@4233 = ~(Older and older you grow, slowly but surely: each second adds months, and although your faces remain young and clear, the look in your reflection's eyes, slight changes in her figure, and Xan's slowly whitening hair whisper of the centuries that pass you by. You hear a child's laughter in the distance, a sob, a rustle of leaves - and a beautiful four-poster bed appears in a sunlit room. A familiar hand joins yours, as if inviting on a journey, a clear, shining light fills the mirror - and it is over.)~
@4234 = ~(You are looking into Xan's eyes again. He lowers his hand, letting the illusion drop, and then speaks very softly.)~
@4235 = ~Each year I ponder the road not yet traveled. But this time there are two. Twenty years from now, we may well meet my birthday together, I should guess. But... how?~
@4236 = ~Together. And it's all that matters.~
@4237 = ~Shh. Enough doom for today. Rest now.~
@4238 = ~It could be worse, you know. We could be dead.~
@4239 = ~Um... Happy birthday?~
@4240 = ~(Xan smiles suddenly.) You are right, melamin. As ever.~
@4241 = ~Thank you. For being with me, for guiding me through these waters, and for staying yourself. May the morning find us rested - and may the road bring us home.~
@4242 = ~I just want to rest, Xan.~
@4243 = ~Then rest well.~
@4244 = ~(Before leaving the common room, Xan slips you an elaborate key. There is a room number engraved on it.)~ [O#XAN000]
@4245 = ~(Use the key)~
@4246 = ~(Go straight to bed)~
@4247 = ~Our endless, aimless wandering does not make me inclined for conversation. Perhaps <CHARNAME> will have words for you?~ [O#XAN000]
@4248 = ~Is it possible to break our elven bond, Xan?~
@4249 = ~Through death, certainly. And I would be grateful if you stopped looking at the dagger at my belt so strangely, <CHARNAME>. It is blunt silver for spell components: rather useless for the fine art of assassinating.~
@4250 = ~What? I wasn't doing anything of the sort!~
@4251 = ~And Xan is joking. Truly, the end of the world is nigh.~
@4252 = ~Well, you never know when you'll need a handy dagger.~
@4253 = ~I was not serious, melamin. But this is how bonds are usually broken, or, rather, transcended: through death, when one of the lovers departs this plane. Treachery, betrayal - it happens, too, but I could never apply it to our case. Can you? (sigh) No, it is always abstract... and when it is not, always sudden.~
@4254 = ~You sound sad.~
@4255 = ~Treachery? Do you mean cheating?~
@4256 = ~In all my time, I have never seen a bond broken because of it, but I heard stories - and, of course, with my mind being attuned to doom and hopelessness, I relived the tales more than once in the darkness of my room.~
@4257 = ~It is sad indeed, is it not? That a heartbreak is often considered worse than a lover's death. It should be the other way around, any sensible person would tell you that - but the heart vehemently disagrees.~
@4258 = ~You would rather I died than left you?~
@4259 = ~I know. It is the same with me.~
@4260 = ~I disagree. Death is final - a heartbreak can be mended.~
@4261 = ~No. Oh, no. Never that. But I do not know which would bring more pain - and honestly, are you?~
@4262 = ~Can it? The bond changes your body and spirit, do not forget that. When the shock comes, not everyone survives the consequences.~
@4263 = ~Regardless, in all the stories I heard in Evereska, the betrayed lover dies. Or becomes a Banshee, Seldarine forbid.~
@4264 = ~(sigh) Breaking a bond is not a grand tale with redemptions and reunions. It is literally losing what you hold most dear. Literally dying slowly... like my mother had. Finding emptiness in your mind, heart, spirit...~
@4265 = ~But I have not answered your original question; forgive me. Each bond is unique, but I should guess that in our case it must mean physical separation, not just intent. I still could die from the grief, but at least you would not... feel it.~
@4266 = ~I just wanted to be sure that our bond *won't* break, Xan.~
@4267 = ~I saved you from Bodhi for a reason: I want you to live, Xan. With me. So no grief and heartbreak for you - you won't be so lucky!~
@4268 = ~In other words, to break our bond, I should kick you out of the party forever?~
@4269 = ~Yes.~
@4270 = ~I know, Estel'amin. And if anything can be counted on in this fickle world - I am counting on it.~
@4271 = ~I love you. I know not whether our bond withstands time, death, cataclysms or ascension - but I know that I love you and I always will. And that, strangely, brings me peace.~
@4272 = ~Luridel should be bright tonight... pity we missed the time. Remember, I once told you that the Philosopher's star is actually a planet? A gas giant of greenish-blue, populated by avians. The sunrise must be spectacular: thousands of birds bathing in the light...~
@4273 = ~Does my close friendship with Valygar bother you?~
@4274 = ~No, not at all. He is a good friend of mine, too. Should I be bothered?~
@4275 = ~I don't know. What if we two decide to run away together?~
@4276 = ~He is an attractive man, after all. If I fall in love with him, what happens?~
@4277 = ~Never mind.~
@4278 = ~Of course. You are my friend, too, <CHARNAME>. And there's nothing more precious to me than our friendship.~
@4279 = ~Let me think. You'll return in fifty years with a guilty look on your face?~
@4280 = ~No, that was unworthy of me. Forgive my blunder.~
@4281 = ~I don't know, <CHARNAME>. Your heart is yours, and you are its true master. Or mistress, as the Common Tongue goes. I would like to claim its sole ownership, but some hearts are simply not built that way.~
@4282 = ~So, you'll accept polyamory?~
@4283 = ~And yours?~
@4284 = ~I'm not sure about mine.~
@4285 = ~With Valygar? Not really. But I will understand if you lapse.~
@4286 = ~Once. Not twenty times in a row. And that's my final word on the matter.~
@4287 = ~I am rather sure about mine. It belongs to you, as you well know.~
@4288 = ~But it should not diminish your friendship with Valygar. What if you ascend? You'll regret the days of not enjoying small talk with him forever.~
@4289 = ~Calimshite slavers.

Thankfully, Xan is free again. But somehow, I do not think it is over.~
