@0    = ~Dynaheir... Khalid... Imoen... (sigh) I am sorry to hear of your past misfortunes. Do you have the slightest idea of what your captor wanted?~ [O#XAN048]
@1    = ~The Hero of the Sword Coast's wealth and magical trinkets, most likely.~
@2    = ~No, I haven't. Do you have any?~
@3    = ~Of course I do! I am a Bhaalspawn, Xan! Have you forgotten?~
@4    = ~I do not want to discuss it.~
@5    = ~And he kept you for so long only to resell them on Athkatla's black market? Ridiculous.~
@6    = ~Me? Seldarine, if I had, I would be sitting on the High Council of Evereska! No, no, I have no idea.~
@7    = ~Your peculiar heritage played its role, I suppose. But why, and how? I have heard of Bhaalspawn killed or exiled on suspicions of evil. An unscrupulous organization might use one of your ilk. But your case is neither here nor there. So what could it be?~
@8    = ~Why are you so interested? That does not concern you.~
@9    = ~Power? Could my captor put my divine essence to his use somehow?~
@10   = ~He promised me power. Irenicus. He said something about my potential.~
@11   = ~(sigh) This I certainly understand.~
@12   = ~On the contrary, it is my foremost worry. Your safety means my continued existence, and unlike you, I value the last one a lot.~
@13   = ~But I see that you are not interested in continuing this conversation. So be it.~
@14   = ~Using your divinity? But who would want to tamper with the cursed heritage of Bhaal?~
@15   = ~Ah, but we are talking about a madman, are we not? Yes, of course. For some people, the task is merely 'challenging'.~
@16   = ~A man captures you and kills your former companions, and you think he acted for your benefit? You are more naive than I had thought.~
@17   = ~I would be wary if I were you. This tormentor of yours - Irenicus, was it? 'Shattered one' - a name that speaks for itself... So, this Irenicus may return, and your nightmare will begin anew. You should be ready for this.~
@18   = ~Cowled Wizards guard their prisoners well. I am safe, for now.~
@19   = ~It is he who should be prepared! Once I find him, I shall crush him where he stands!~
@20   = ~You are right. What if he returns? There is no shelter for me anywhere!~
@21   = ~It is pointless. He will find and kill me regardless.~
@22   = ~Indeed. We shall see what happens later.~
@23   = ~Oh, I am sure that he is trembling in trepidation already. But I am wasting my time. As I said, if he wants to capture you again, he certainly will.~
@24   = ~As I have already told you, we're all doomed.~
@25   = ~Yes, I quite agree. Let us move on and talk another time. If we survive, that is.~
@26   = ~These warrens remind me of all the places I passed on my way to Evereska. Every human settlement is the same - gaudy, noisy and redolent of unwashed bodies.~ [O#XAN049]
@27   = ~Evereska? Have you been there recently?~
@28   = ~There are also gardens, fountains, museums and palaces. You see what you choose to see.~
@29   = ~I agree completely. You should have seen the Athkatlan slums, or worse, sewers. Ewww!~
@30   = ~I saw what was there, and I wish I hadn't.~
@31   = ~I have, and it's an ordeal for the senses. Take Beregost, take Baldur's Gate, take Nashkel - they pale in comparison! The more humans there are, the more squalid the city becomes.~
@32   = ~I visited Greyhome last spring, soon after we parted ways, and felt a stranger in my home. The air was crystalline, the terraced gardens in full bloom, the city blissfully quiet - but I was lost within her walls. After years of wandering human lands, I brought the remembrance with me, and was not able to shake it off.~
@33   = ~See, you missed Baldur's Gate, after all! Admit it, you got used to the human lands!~
@34   = ~Do you really like this noise and dirt more than Evereska?~
@35   = ~Poor you.~
@36   = ~I see. But enough talk for today.~
@37   = ~No, you misunderstand. I treasure the sight of my city above all else. It was another feeling that shocked me back then. Loneliness.~
@38   = ~Very much so, <CHARNAME>. It was just what I thought on the day of my arrival.~
@39   = ~As you wish. I shall follow your lead - to another adventure doomed to fail, no doubt.~
@40   = ~It is a terrible fate: to be doomed to endless wandering, forever denied your home. Before that day, I was sure: should I return, I would feel welcome. But that hope was crushed, and brutally, at that.~
@41   = ~I am sorry. But perhaps it is not that bad?~
@42   = ~Do you still feel the same way?~
@43   = ~Sure! Who would want to live in the same city with a doomsayer like you?~
@44   = ~Very sad, I agree. Shall we continue on?~
@45   = ~No, no. I came to terms with myself eventually, but the doubt remained. Greyhome is my safe haven, but am I wanted there? Perhaps the Greycloaks are hand-picked from those who have no place among their fellow beings, and their only use is to fight and die, often needlessly? Is my duty truly a great honor, or simply an empty pretext to get rid of me?~
@46   = ~This is paranoia, Xan. Of course, as any elf, you are welcome in Evereska.~
@47   = ~He-he, finally figured it out, did you? They must have had a grand celebration after your departure!~
@48   = ~It might be so. But you were given your duty by other elves, not the city itself. Ask them.~
@49   = ~Laugh, if you will. I should have known better than to talk to you.~
@50   = ~It could be that you are right - or I would like to think so. I apologize for distracting you, in any case.~
@51   = ~How can I? The members of the Council who appointed me carry more authority than perhaps any mortal. Our rule is autocratic and absolute, and it shall not be questioned. But thank you for your opinion, regardless.~
@52   = ~Isn't it pointless?~ [O#XAN050]
@53   = ~Another bout of your doomsaying? I am not interested.~
@54   = ~What is pointless, Xan?~
@55   = ~It is not.~
@56   = ~It is.~
@57   = ~As you say. Talking to you is as pointless as is fighting by your side, it seems.~
@58   = ~Look around. Look at your journal you seem to be so fond of. Look at those who persist in using you. Look at yourself. What do you see?~
@59   = ~I see my future. I see gold, respect, and a promise of power.~
@60   = ~I see people in need of my help, and the good I will bring into this world.~
@61   = ~Nothing. Just bits of old paper, my own clothes, stained with grime, and some mud on the ground.~
@62   = ~Ever optimistic, ever a fool. What do you mean, oh enlightened one?~
@63   = ~After you.~
@64   = ~All this. Though, on second thought, it does not make much sense.~
@65   = ~Nothing. Just said the first thing that came into my head.~
@66   = ~Don't you dare call me a fool!~
@67   = ~Exactly. It is hollow, and makes no sense at all. But, on the other hand, life could be so beautiful and full of meaning, were we spared this chase...~
@68   = ~I did not know you were a coward at heart.~
@69   = ~True. I often think: "if only..."~
@70   = ~You are free to withdraw at any time. What keeps you here?~
@71   = ~I prefer the life of adventure, actually.~
@72   = ~Power... always power. But what if it is no more? What if you got injured, maimed, or simply got old? Where will your promise of power get you?~
@73   = ~I do not think this far. If tomorrow comes, I'll deal with it.~
@74   = ~I'll get enough gold by then to be taken care of, do not worry.~
@75   = ~It will be not a simple promise, but a kingdom under my rule by then. All shall love me and despair! MYAHAHAHAHAHA!~
@76   = ~Act as you will. But when Death shows her face in the window, do not say that I have not warned you. As for me, I prefer being overcautious to being overblown.~
@77   = ~(groan) Oh, Seldarine...~
@78   = ~And how many will die in your search for good? Or should I say 'the Greater Good'? Don't you see the dark side of your actions?~
@79   = ~I do. But the Light shall prevail!~
@80   = ~Yes, there is always one. I am trying hard not to notice it.~
@81   = ~Nevertheless, it is better than skulking in the corners, brooding about the meaninglessness of life.~
@82   = ~Act as you will. But the righteous ones are ever the first to die.~
@83   = ~You are wiser than I have thought. But you will have to deal with it sooner or later, just as I will have to deal with my own weaknesses.~
@84   = ~Your last remark was aimed at me, I take it? (sigh) Yes... I admit it has a grain of truth.~
@85   = ~So, not only an epitome of murder, but a fine example of chaos incarnate, as well. I am sorry for bothering you.~
@86   = ~Do you find consolation in praise, then? Suit yourself, but do not expect me to oblige your whims.~
@87   = ~You know what? I am sick of your preaching. Shut up!~
@88   = ~No, but I do not like it when a member of my party questions my authority.~
@89   = ~Gladly.~
@90   = ~I would not have done it, but blind trust in Lady Luck leads to certain death - our certain death. And I would not like that to happen at all.~
@91   = ~But this conversation does not lead anywhere. I suggest we continue in silence.~
@92   = ~Alas, it is not likely to last.~
@93   = ~I am not a coward, but I am afraid. It sounds more than strange, I know, but there are more terrifying things than bandits and monsters. There is also a betrayal of self. If I abandon my mission, I forsake my duty and thus, deserve to die, forgotten by all.~
@94   = ~You will not forsake Evereska? But what if you find out that it has forsaken you, what then?~
@95   = ~You'd become a hero, because you are afraid not to be one? Do I understand correctly?~
@96   = ~A commendable position. Now, if all people were like this!~
@97   = ~Well, I think it is just plain stupid.~
@98   = ~This, <CHARNAME>, I do not know.~
@99   = ~Yes, <CHARNAME>. (sigh) You do.~
@100  = ~Then the world would turn into a marching army. I doubt you would really want this, would you? But we tarry overlong, and our quest is no less vain than it has been.~
@101  = ~No, it was stupid of me to start this conversation. I shall watch myself better next time.~
@102  = ~A pitiful band we are: poorly equipped, barely trained, and surely not powerful enough to withstand whatever is thrown at us today. But your previous party was no better, as I recall.~ [O#XAN051]
@103  = ~Some of your former companions we have already encountered. I wonder, what happened to the others? Did they meet a premature death as a reward for having traveled with you, or did they get a chance for a calmer, quieter life?~
@104  = ~Does a name spring to your mind?~
@105  = ~I cannot speak for some of them. I feel that they are somewhere close... and I will meet them again.~
@106  = ~Kivan could have returned home, to Shilmista... or re-united with his Deheriana.~
@107  = ~Kagain must be back in Beregost, running his mercenary business.~
@108  = ~I don't know much about Yeslick, but he has probably departed to seek his distant kin.~
@109  = ~You miss Eldoth, do you? Yeah, I sort of wonder, too, where the old rascal might be.~
@110  = ~Eldoth probably abandoned Skie by now. She is either back in Baldur's Gate, or is wandering the wilderness.~
@111  = ~Alora might be still in Baldur's Gate, playing hide-and-seek with the Flaming Fist.~
@112  = ~I have no idea where Branwen is now. Still fighting in Tempus' name, I guess.~
@113  = ~Now that Angelo is dead, Shar-Teel has avenged herself... and I really don't want to think about what she must be doing now.~
@114  = ~They must be wandering somewhere, like we do.~
@115  = ~No... I have no idea where they are.~
@116  = ~I do not care to talk about this.~
@117  = ~Perhaps. You and I met again, after all.~
@118  = ~I hope they are alive, in any case. But are they any better off than you and I?~
@119  = ~I feel sorry for him. But if your second guess is true, then he is dead, as we all soon will be. Still, he chose it himself.~
@120  = ~Tazok chose it for him first.~
@121  = ~He might be still alive, though.~
@122  = ~Probably. I hope he is happy, wherever he is.~
@123  = ~What does Tazok have to do with it? The choice of ending one's life is solely his. Though, in a sense, you are right.~
@124  = ~(sigh) I doubt it.~
@125  = ~This... businessdwarf will be at home anywhere, I'm sure. And eager to throw himself into any profitable venture, no matter how dangerous. (sigh) Dwarves...~
@126  = ~We always disliked them, didn't we?~
@127  = ~It's funny how elves dislike dwarves.~
@128  = ~Watch your tongue when speaking of my kin, elf!~
@129  = ~It's funny how elves dislike dwarves.~
@130  = ~He got powerful in my company, so he can take care of himself.~
@131  = ~Yes, his passion for money will be the death of him.~
@132  = ~We do not dislike them, no. There is no point in hating everybody whose way of life we do not understand. Kagain, however, was a special case. Greedy, lazy, and a mercenary at heart - he was hardly a pleasant companion.~
@133  = ~Can he? Could you take care of yourself, when you were captured and stripped of your possessions?~
@134  = ~Yes, he will be dead soon enough, if he isn't already.~
@135  = ~My apologies, if I sounded offensive. I was not intending to berate your kin; rather, to show you the same pattern in the fate of your each and every companion.~
@136  = ~Yeslick was just another victim of human greed. But he was not bad, for a dwarf. He did not deserve to witness these horrors - and the flood of his clan's home afterwards. Wherever he is, I hope that he has found peace.~
@137  = ~So do I.~
@138  = ~I don't care.~
@139  = ~Fie, <CHARNAME>! Why did you even mention the name? Now I have a dreadful headache... ooooohhhh... excuse me...~
@140  = ~Poor girl. She never deserved this fate.~
@141  = ~Liked her, did you?~
@142  = ~I would like to be proven wrong.~
@143  = ~(sigh) Yes.~
@144  = ~Ah, of course. You were raised by humans, so you ever take pity for love. No, I did not 'like' her in the sense you are implying, but she was a beautiful, misguided child just the same.~
@145  = ~Giving them toothaches, I do not doubt. But frivolities aside, the child will be hanged sooner or later. Rogues never connect the word 'risk' to the word 'death'.~
@146  = ~We do, Xan. Otherwise we all would have been dead long ago.~
@147  = ~It is a pity indeed.~
@148  = ~She might survive, though. You never know.~
@149  = ~I highly doubt 'lucky' means the same as 'invincible'. Sooner or later, every adventurer fails, and for rogues it happens twice as quickly.~
@150  = ~Yes, and deafens some other misfortunate souls with her barbaric battle cries. Well, at least it is not us.~
@151  = ~I miss her, though. She was a fine person and a good friend.~
@152  = ~She was too barbaric for my taste, I admit.~
@153  = ~I wonder where she is now...~
@154  = ~That sounded frighteningly like an epitaph. But perhaps you are not far from the truth.~
@155  = ~Oh, she was not bad, compared to that dreadful harridan of a woman - what was her name? Yes, Shar-Teel.~
@156  = ~We can safely assume she is dead, I suppose. With her manners and the self-preservation instinct of a fly, I doubt she still lives.~
@157  = ~She is a good fighter, so she might, at that.~
@158  = ~You are probably right.~
@159  = ~I couldn't care less about what happened to her.~
@160  = ~Not for long, in any case.~
@161  = ~So, you do not care about your former companions' possible fate? This suggests a lot... and gives me some food for thought, as well.~
@162  = ~Don't you see it, <CHARNAME>? Wherever your former companions are, and you can speculate endlessly, they are not happy. They are either dead, or feebly struggle to find peace. It is futile to pursue happiness, but especially so for those who call themselves adventurers.~
@163  = ~This is only one example. Others have surely fared better.~
@164  = ~I suppose you are right.~
@165  = ~Anyone can find their own true happiness, if they try hard enough.~
@166  = ~Xan, leave me be! I do not care whether they are happy or not.~
@167  = ~I know I am right. There is either a dead adventurer, or a disappointed adventurer. A happy adventurer is an extinct species nowadays... if he existed at all.~
@168  = ~Do they? How do you determine whether they try enough, then?~
@169  = ~The difference between you and me is that I believe I can be happy. You do not.~
@170  = ~Once you are happy, you have tried enough.~
@171  = ~It is not for me to determine, Xan. It's up to you.~
@172  = ~No, I do not. But your stubborn faith makes me doubt myself.~
@173  = ~Do you mean: "once the impossible happens, you tried enough"? Your logic is flawed, haven't you noticed this?~
@174  = ~But I've lost interest in this discussion. Let us move on.~
@175  = ~I have no desire to determine what I know to be impossible. There is either a dead adventurer, or a disappointed adventurer. A happy adventurer is an extinct species nowadays - if he existed at all.~
@176  = ~They say that love cures all. Blinds one to the horrors of this existence, more likely. What is the point in hiding behind another equally doomed soul? It will only make me dread death all the more.~ [O#XAN052]
@177  = ~Um, why are you telling me this?~
@178  = ~Love is more than this, Xan. It is a wonderful feeling.~
@179  = ~Your words make me wonder whether you are more afraid to fall in love than to die.~
@180  = ~Indeed. Love is pointless.~
@181  = ~Because you are doomed to taste it very soon. I hate telling you this, but you are young, charismatic and capable, and there'll be no lack of female companions eager to throw themselves into your arms. Or, rather, to become a dead weight around your neck.~
@182  = ~You have a rather pessimistic disposition.~
@183  = ~How can you say such things? Love is glorious!~
@184  = ~Do not worry, I can handle it.~
@185  = ~Really? Thanks for the warning. I'll be wary around them now.~
@186  = ~Ah... nothing indecent whatsoever, I assure you. It is just... as you were left without a... guardian...~
@187  = ~Yes?~
@188  = ~Xan, trust me, I do not need one.~
@189  = ~(grin) You, my guardian? Oh, Xan, admit it, there's more to this!~
@190  = ~Why, thank you. I had no idea that you cared so much.~
@191  = ~Oh, never mind.~
@192  = ~Love is neither wonderful nor glorious. It is a vice, an illness that should be cured. Do you know that elves who have never been in love live longer? Their hearts wear down slower, unlike those of 'tender' nature. To love is to slowly kill oneself.~
@193  = ~Both are inevitable, I suppose. But who is forewarned is also armed. I may avoid death for a while if I watch the shadows. I may avoid love if I pay attention to my thoughts.~
@194  = ~Pointless, trite, and hurtful. I am glad that we understand each other.~
@195  = ~No, <CHARNAME>, I do not believe in love.~
@196  = ~What about religion? It is love in its purest form.~
@197  = ~But everyone loves sooner or later. Adolescence usually means first love.~
@198  = ~You never loved a woman? I do not believe it.~
@199  = ~Sometimes I think that neither do I.~
@200  = ~So said Corellon Larethian himself, when he was warned of his wife Araushnee's evil nature. He did not listen, and Araushnee went on with her betrayal. She is called Lolth now. I trust you have heard the name?~
@201  = ~You are welcome, of course. (sigh) How I wish I had been given such advice decades ago...~
@202  = ~Oh, Seldarine... Why have I started this conversation in the first place?~
@203  = ~Gods are to be revered, not loved. How would you measure a deity in mortal terms? Corellon is neither a man nor a woman, and the myths you have probably heard of Tel'Seldarine are but humans' tales. As you have the blood of an immortal in you, you should know that much.~
@204  = ~Besides, even those who entrust their souls to a deity are not safe: their hearts, too, may become someone's prey.~
@205  = ~It was... too long ago to remember.~
@206  = ~But elves have long memories. Don't you remember anything?~
@207  = ~But we reverie every night... haven't you revived the memory of her in your dreams?~
@208  = ~I see.~
@209  = ~And not pleasant, I believe?~
@210  = ~Yes... let us move on.~
@211  = ~<CHARNAME>, do you truly wish us to exchange tales?~
@212  = ~Yes!~
@213  = ~Why not? We are steady comrades in arms, we have already shared much, why not this, too?~
@214  = ~Er, no, I do not want to know.~
@215  = ~I am not telling you anything!~
@216  = ~Didn't Gorion teach you that a secret belongs to two people? Or do his bedchamber adventures occupy an honorary place among the tomes of Candlekeep? Regardless, I think it is time to drop the subject.~
@217  = ~I am glad you have come to your senses.~
@218  = ~Why, then, do we warn each other, watch our thoughts carefully and regard love as a bad case of a sea-sickness, but still keep falling for the same trap?~
@219  = ~You know why. One cannot defy Hanali Celanil.~
@220  = ~You know why. One cannot defy the will of Sune.~
@221  = ~Such is our nature.~
@222  = ~You may fall for this trap. I will not.~
@223  = ~True enough. Not even Corellon can protect from her strange and terrible influence. And my people have the nerve to call it benevolent!~
@224  = ~And humans call her Heartwarder. Heartbreaker, more like.~
@225  = ~True enough. (sigh) What can change the nature of a man?~
@226  = ~I have heard this phrase somewhere...~
@227  = ~Love?~
@228  = ~Time, and patience.~
@229  = ~Nothing.~
@230  = ~I'd say you are well on the way already, but you will probably not listen.~
@231  = ~It is an eternal question, and we mortals are ever searching for an answer.~
@232  = ~Yes, I admire your sense of humor. (sigh) Insufferable...~
@233  = ~For the People, to live does not mean to change with time, so your answer does not sit well with us. For the races with shorter lifespans, however, it may be correct.~
@234  = ~Indeed.~
@235  = ~Athkatla is a testament to my nerves. How is it you are able to endure these crowds?~ [O#XAN053]
@236  = ~It is not a problem for me. I am a city person, actually.~
@237  = ~It takes time to get used to, I agree.~
@238  = ~Me? I hate cities. Always did.~
@239  = ~I'd rather not talk of this now.~
@240  = ~Well, now you can close your eyes and relax among the trees.~
@241  = ~I still prefer Athkatlan buildings and parks to - to *this*.~
@242  = ~It is a brief respite... but thank you, regardless.~
@243  = ~(shudder) Yes. Oh, yes, I quite agree.~
@244  = ~I envy you. My own stay in a human city usually ends up in not being able to cast any magic for hours, if not days.~
@245  = ~For me, all the time in the world would not be enough. The longer I stay in the city, the worse it becomes.~
@246  = ~You might change your mind if you see Evereska. But, of course, with your precarious heritage it is nigh impossible.~
@247  = ~Yes, it does not do my headache any good, either. Let us find a quiet place: my ears are aching for rest.~
@248  = ~In Evereska, it is different. Every level of the city is covered in trees which muffle the sound, and in the open space nobody is inclined to shout. I have heard a saying that every terrace has its own unique form of silence, not heavy and pressing, but soothing, comforting...~
@249  = ~Sounds good to me! I'd like to visit Evereska some day.~
@250  = ~Must be a boring life, then.~
@251  = ~Do you miss it?~
@252  = ~A <LADYLORD> of Murder, in Evereska, bringing destruction to everything <HESHE> touches? No, that would be a horror beyond my wildest nightmares. Forget this conversation, <CHARNAME>. Evereska must not suffer because of our acquaintance.~
@253  = ~If you wish for naught but battles, then yes, it will be boring to you. But for those who revel in contemplation of nature and perfection of their art, it is close to Arvandor on Toril.~
@254  = ~But of course I do.~
@255  = ~Do you yourself not long for peace? Hell is other people, they say. It is wrong, for no elf can exist outside of the community, and almost no elf would want such a fate. But the unceasing bustle of the human cities is worse than voluntary exile.~
@256  = ~Adventurers get the worst of it: always on the move, exploring the worst regions of the city, we are exposed to the foulest aspects of city life. I do not think I can continue like this indefinitely. Or do you find it tolerable?~
@257  = ~Tolerable? It is the best life there is!~
@258  = ~Yes, I do. Such is life, and I must accept it.~
@259  = ~No, I do not. But a Bhaalspawn does not get a choice.~
@260  = ~Yes, hell is other people. You. What part of 'I am tired of you' don't you understand?~
@261  = ~I'd like to hear what you will say in fifty years or so. But it is good to hear that one of us enjoys this dreary existence.~
@262  = ~Yes, the words 'no choice' probably describe it all. Still, if you outlive your siblings, you will be given a choice of sorts, as Alaundo claimed. Great choices are based on simple things, and if simple life is not enough for you, you will not find enough resolve to decline your heritage. If you only follow your current path out of obligation, however, you may be wise enough to stay mortal.~
@263  = ~Heritage? Mortal? Xan, what are you talking about?~
@264  = ~Well, I could decide I've no choice but to become a god, see?~
@265  = ~I do not see myself as a deity.~
@266  = ~Maybe, maybe not, but it will not happen soon.~
@267  = ~Stay with me, and you may see for yourself.~
@268  = ~You should have expressed yourself earlier.~
@269  = ~You do not know? You grew up at Candlekeep, and you do not know? Seldarine, it is a hopeless cause if I ever saw one.~
@270  = ~I would not jest with such things. Not to take one's nature seriously could be disastrous in your case.~
@271  = ~It is a good sign. However, you are a demigod, and your divine counterpart has not had her say, yet. We can only wait - or dread - your further transformation.~
@272  = ~If at all. Most likely I will die and never find out.~
@273  = ~I do not think I will. More and more people die in your wake... I am not sure I want to take part in this any longer.~
@274  = ~We are venturing ever onward, but are we making any progress at all?~ [O#XAN054]
@275  = ~I am so tired of repeating the same inquiries over and over, of running errands for those who could soon become our adversaries, of dreading your heritage showing itself... Why did I even join you?~
@276  = ~I have a nasty suspicion that you are spying on me, Xan.~
@277  = ~Because your Greycloak duties demanded it. What exactly are they, by the way?~
@278  = ~Why indeed? I should like to know that.~
@279  = ~You certainly have reasons to be suspicious. Nearly every powerful organization showed its interest in you, evil or otherwise. Zhentarim, Harpers, Shadow Thieves, the Most Holy Order of the Most Holy... never mind. Quite an impressive list so far.~
@280  = ~But while I would lie if I said I wasn't wary around you, a spy I am not. Listen.~
@281  = ~Ah, and now you will not leave me alone until you know the complete history of Evereska and her defenders. (sigh) Very well, you will get your wish to<DAYNIGHT>.~
@282  = ~I did tell you I was performing a mission when I met you, did I not? Well, I suppose it won't hurt if you hear the rest of it.~
@283  = ~(sigh) I should have guessed long ago that you did not.~
@284  = ~I shall have to start from the very beginning, I'm afraid. We elves are an immortal race, and with rare exceptions, we fear very little in this world. However, there are things, or, rather, creatures we regard with utmost terror. Do you know what they are?~
@285  = ~I am an elf, too! Of course I do: you are talking about undead.~
@286  = ~No, I do not.~
@287  = ~Death?~
@288  = ~Undead?~
@289  = ~Drow, of course.~
@290  = ~Yes, and I am sorry for underestimating you. Gorion, your teacher, was a human, so I was not aware of how much you knew about your own race.~
@291  = ~I expected that you did not: from one who grew up among humans, it is only natural. Besides, we are good at concealing our fears from other races. Our greatest fear is undead, <CHARNAME>.~
@292  = ~Death? While some would imagine her as an old crone, and others as a beautiful woman, I doubt she has a personification on this Plane. No, it was undead I was talking about.~
@293  = ~Yes, you are correct.~
@294  = ~These abominations? Not in the least. We reserve our darkest emotions for the drow, that much is true, but fear is not among them. No, it was undead I was talking about.~
@295  = ~We loathe and fear these monsters. A year ago, while hunting your beast of a brother in the Undercity, in the midst of ghosts and ghouls, I suffered mortality pangs of the worst kind.~
@296  = ~But this mindless vermin was not the worst. There are sentient undead, a real danger to our way of life. Do you realize how much damage a nearly immortal vampire can cause? Their plans span centuries, and when they come to fruition, they destroy communities.~
@297  = ~Of course, nobody will allow a vampire coven to spawn in Evereska, but humans do not guard their territories as jealously. Are you still listening?~
@298  = ~I follow you so far.~
@299  = ~Yes, and I understand why you arrived in Athkatla. You got news of vampire sightings here, didn't you?~
@300  = ~No, I've lost interest.~
@301  = ~Very well. (sigh) I wonder if there is any sense in talking to you at all?~
@302  = ~Astute. Yes, my superiors provided me with the necessary information. These were not only sightings; they got news that vampires were engaged in the shadow activities of the city.~
@303  = ~After the rumors had been confirmed, I was appointed to a new task, my last one, I do not doubt: to learn of their plans and concerns, and to report back immediately if their schemes proved more than a vague threat. A suicidal mission, in other words. At the time I thought they were eager to get rid of me. Such an idea is preposterous... possibly... I am sure it is...~
@304  = ~Xan? Are you all right?~
@305  = ~Do not fret, Xan. I never liked undead, so I will help you when the time comes.~
@306  = ~I don't know if I want to help you. I mean, there must be many of them, and powerful, too.~
@307  = ~Wait, but we might need their help to retrieve Imoen from the Cowled Wizards!~
@308  = ~I am glad we share the same task. We'll destroy these creatures once and for all!~
@309  = ~Well, now we have completed this task, and you are free to return to Evereska.~
@310  = ~No, I am not. I find less and less inspiration in my duty, when I need confidence and concentration in the face of an enemy. I am surely doomed.~
@311  = ~It is the strain of adventuring. You'll finish this mission, rest for a while, and feel better.~
@312  = ~Yes, oh Epitome of Doomsaying and Verbose Moroseness, you are! Prepare to meet thy inevitable destruction!~
@313  = ~You'd better pull yourself together. I do not need a slipshod mage in my party.~
@314  = ~I am likely to die soon, anyway.~
@315  = ~Oh, yes, your humor is impeccable as ever. If only it wasn't true, I could even have a laugh.~
@316  = ~Their help? Their... help? <CHARNAME>, do you jest, or are you truly insane? They are vampires, intent on naught but betrayal and their personal gain. Do you expect their leader to keep their word?~
@317  = ~If they can help, I will accept their assistance, no matter the cost. Imoen must be safe.~
@318  = ~I shall make them keep their word.~
@319  = ~Perhaps you are right. I'll think about it.~
@320  = ~And what about yourself? Or myself, for that matter? Or others, whose lives depend on your actions? You must not forget your responsibility, or you will be harshly reminded of your duties, and soon.~
@321  = ~You are right, Xan. I will do my best to avoid such a mistake.~
@322  = ~Imoen's life is much more important.~
@323  = ~I know, but I do not have any choice.~
@324  = ~I highly doubt it. Do as you will, but do not count on my assistance, should you ally yourself with such creatures.~
@325  = ~I beg of you, do.~
@326  = ~I do not intend to destroy them all; I cannot. But learning of their plans is essential, and I hope that you will help me. I have even come as far as to rely on your aid.~
@327  = ~And you are right in this. If I can help you, I will.~
@328  = ~Fool! Have you learned nothing? I have been using you all the way!~
@329  = ~You are welcome to travel with me, but I cannot promise anything.~
@330  = ~Thank you, my friend.~
@331  = ~A fool indeed. I wish I had another choice... but without your help, I can do nothing. Do not expect friendliness from me, however.~
@332  = ~I have no other choice; I may as well stay with you for the time being. However, a moment may come when I will have to leave your company.~
@333  = ~And leave you here, in a state worse than death? Do you wish to die so badly that you would push away your last surviving allies?~
@334  = ~Were you alive and whole, I would indeed leave, but I cannot abandon a friend in such a sorry state. No, <CHARNAME>. I am with you until the end.~
@335  = ~Once realising that I was to die at any moment, I started to dwell on peculiar things. The ties that bind, for example. Friendship and camaraderie, both in elven and non-elven senses of these words. What is friendship to you, I wonder?~ [O#XAN055]
@336  = ~Heh, good question.~
@337  = ~An excuse to push people around, I guess.~
@338  = ~Something warm and comfortable, like going home.~
@339  = ~A union of trust and understanding.~
@340  = ~How does an elven friendship differ from a non-elven one?~
@341  = ~A quiet relationship, if you know what I mean.~
@342  = ~Oh, I understand perfectly. Let us continue in silence, then.~
@343  = ~You would do well to remember that some people push back. Does nothing attract you in other people, besides using them?~
@344  = ~No.~
@345  = ~There might be something, but I cannot quite put a finger on it.~
@346  = ~In this case, there is no point in talking to you.~
@347  = ~Yes, it seems so. Warmth, trust, sharing - does it mean that all things we cannot find in ourselves, we search for in another? If so, a strong individual does not need friends at all.~
@348  = ~It is not necessarily true, Xan. Everybody needs a friend, even a paragon of self-sufficiency.~
@349  = ~An interesting take. Do you mean that only the weak ones befriend?~
@350  = ~Agreed. Love, friendship and attachment are foolish, and to express them is to show weakness.~
@351  = ~It might be that I am wrong, since I do not have many friends. But I have seen some cases of so-called 'friendship', and these were truly pathetic.~
@352  = ~No, I suppose not. Still, sometimes I wonder whether there is any point in having friends, especially for an adventurer treading the path of danger.~
@353  = ~I did sound like this, didn't I? No, I did not truly mean it... though, now you mention it, my attitude horribly reminds me of a drow's. I am sorry, <CHARNAME>; let us continue this discussion another time. I need to gather my thoughts.~
@354  = ~Ah, we have been traveling together for so long I am sometimes taking you for a fellow elf from Evereska, forgetting once again that you were raised among humans.~
@355  = ~We belong to the communal spirit, <CHARNAME>. Every elf's soul is linked to the Weave, and consequently, to the Upper Planes, to the Plane of Arvandor. This link also means I am aware of every living creature around us, and doubly so, of another elf, with whom I am able to enter the state of communion, sharing our souls and thoughts.~
@356  = ~This is so interesting! Could you tell me more?~
@357  = ~So, could you enter this state with me?~
@358  = ~What else do you wish to know? We reverie instead of sleep, reliving our memories, but you are aware of this already, are you not? The state of reverie and communion are considered relatively safe, for our hidden mental reserves spring to life, blocking out the prying eyes and ears. But I am still convinced that I will be killed during my reverie some day...~
@359  = ~Stop your doomsaying, Xan, you will not. Just go on about the elves.~
@360  = ~I hope not. Is there anything else you can tell me about?~
@361  = ~Blocking out the prying eyes and ears? So, you could have some fun with a girl, and nobody would notice, eh?~
@362  = ~That's enough, I think. Thank you.~
@363  = ~You forget about your heritage. Your spirit holds in check Bhaal's influence, but it will not do us good to experiment with your elven abilities. You will have to open your mind fully... and I shudder to think about what might crawl out.~
@364  = ~Very rarely, we form bonds with other elves, or, more rarely still, with beings of other races. When the bond is formed, the elf and his chosen become true mates, able to sense each other's emotions and enjoy their mutual love in full. There is a downside, obviously: once one of the pair dies, it is not unusual for the other to die of grief. That was how my mother died...~
@365  = ~I am so sorry...~
@366  = ~It was very... enlightening.~
@367  = ~I suggest you continue this conversation with a more appreciative listener. I am not interested in such frivolities. Not with death waiting for us just around the corner.~
@368  = ~C'mon, relax! Say what: next time we rest in a decent inn, I'll send for girls and wine for both of us! How does it sound to you?~
@369  = ~C'mon, relax! Say what: next time we rest in a decent inn, you and me could have some fun ourselves! How does it sound to you?~
@370  = ~I am sorry, Xan. It was a silly joke. Could you please tell me more of your kin?~
@371  = ~I take it you've been drinking too much Evermead lately. Be careful, <CHARNAME>: of all the paths of self-destruction, this is the surest one.~
@372  = ~Don't be. You've got enough to feel sorry for yourself. But I would rather move on now, if you do not mind.~
@373  = ~Yes, well... I told you more than I intended, and certainly more than I should have. But we were talking of friendship in general, were we not?~
@374  = ~And not an easy one to answer, I take it?~
@375  = ~What do we need friendship for? I understand the need of a simple craftsman or a farmer, who has a stability of sorts. But we who are to die any hour, what do we seek?~
@376  = ~Friends make us feel safe. Or safer, at least.~
@377  = ~Friends help us understand what we are, and what we want.~
@378  = ~Don't you, yourself, like to be listened to and cared about? That is your answer.~
@379  = ~You cannot see it with your eyes. You have to feel it with your heart.~
@380  = ~But do you need this illusion of safety? An enemy's sword will still chop your head off, whether you feel safe or not.~
@381  = ~Yes, just before we die. Much good will this knowledge do you.~
@382  = ~Do you imply that you are my friend, then?~
@383  = ~Yes. Are you?~
@384  = ~It is close to friendship, I think.~
@385  = ~Call it whatever you like.~
@386  = ~No, Xan, I am not.~
@387  = ~That was a truly elven thing to say, my friend.~
@388  = ~I suppose I am... my friend.~
@389  = ~I think you are right... friend.~
@390  = ~I shall call it friendship, then. Though I have no idea about the point of it all.~
@391  = ~Yes, there is no point in friendship on the brink of death. I agree with you on that one.~
@392  = ~You have undergone many tests as of late. Judging by the fact that you are still alive, you have passed every single one. But one of your virtues remains untested.~ [O#XAN056]
@393  = ~Which one?~
@394  = ~Ha, I am the epitome of virtue! Bow before me, for you are unworthy!~
@395  = ~Let me guess...~
@396  = ~Let's move on and test it quietly, then.~
@397  = ~You will not, because I am not speaking of your character.~
@398  = ~I am speaking of your gold. What is money in your life?~
@399  = ~Why do you need to know?~
@400  = ~Money? My one and only passion!~
@401  = ~All my money will be spent on Imoen's rescue.~
@402  = ~I am not poor, as you have probably noticed.~
@403  = ~I am not rich, as you have probably noticed.~
@404  = ~I am not discussing my money with anyone!~
@405  = ~Because when in peril, every little bit helps, and having something better than the useless junk we are wielding now would not decrease our chances for survival, either.~
@406  = ~Junk?! We have the finest equipment, for your information!~
@407  = ~As soon as we have some money to spare, I'll see what I can do.~
@408  = ~I am not spending a single gold piece over what is strictly necessary! It is my money! My own! My precious!~
@409  = ~I am doing my best, as you well know, but Imoen's rescue goes first.~
@410  = ~Are you sure you do not have dragon blood in addition to Bhaal's? Spare me the laudatory rhetorics, please. I've had enough chances to listen to dwarven songs both in the Copper Coronet and back on the Sword Coast, and I assure you, it was an unpleasant pastime. If I hear "Gold, Gold, Gold" once again, you'll be deprived of your party mage.~
@411  = ~But will it help the girl if we arrive to her rescue unarmed and unexperienced? Try to maintain a balance between your feelings and cold reason, if you will.~
@412  = ~I do not look over your shoulder as you are counting coins. But I trust your common sense. Perhaps you will not make the mistakes which young fools, fresh from under their parents' wing, are so eager to make.~
@413  = ~Suit yourself.~
@414  = ~Indeed? I see a little snag, however: there are dozens of your demigod rivals, each equipped as well, or possibly even better, than you are. Not to mention your other adversary, Irenicus. You may want to consider this. But speaking of money...~
@415  = ~Normally, we elves do not care for money as much as humans do, but after decades of negotiating, the habit of treating my expenses with care comes almost naturally to me. Having watched myself for a while, I started to wonder: is it a virtue or a vice?~
@416  = ~Money is not evil in itself. But placing too much value in it can ruin one's life.~
@417  = ~It depends on what you are calling a virtue.~
@418  = ~If you use the money to help the poor and needy, why not?~
@419  = ~How many times do I have to tell you this? Money is good, more money is better!~
@420  = ~But how much is too much? How do you determine the difference between greed and need? Indeed, it is a perfect model of your own situation. When you strike a blow, do you give in to the taint, or do you restrain yourself? Where do you draw the line?~
@421  = ~I am balancing on the edge. Do not worry, things will work themselves out.~
@422  = ~I fight the taint daily, and have succeeded so far. If we believe in ourselves, we shall find the balance.~
@423  = ~I pray for the answer every night, and my deity responds.~
@424  = ~We are discussing my heritage again. I do not enjoy it.~
@425  = ~Ah, the eternal question of what is good and what is evil. Do you presume to know the answer?~
@426  = ~No, but I am seeking it.~
@427  = ~My deity's way is answer enough.~
@428  = ~I am simply trying to do good, as much as I can.~
@429  = ~My way is the right way, and whoever disagrees, dies. Clear enough?~
@430  = ~I should abandon all hope of purchasing better equipment, I see.~
@431  = ~(sigh)~
@432  = ~No, you will either come to the self-whipping path of 'righteousness', or think up a quick justification and dive into the dark pits, either the ones designed by your sire or your own. And the balance... the balance is an illusion.~
@433  = ~Blessed are those who have easy answers...~
@434  = ~You are true to your father's name. Excuse me while I continue to disagree in silence.~
@435  = ~They will work themselves out - with your death, if nothing else - but will it help you? Eventually, you will fall.~
@436  = ~You have my word that I do not enjoy it, either. But I shall drop the subject, if you like.~
@437  = ~Yes, yes, of course. But I am not speaking of your character.~
@438  = ~Death puts an end to many things.~ [O#XAN057]
@439  = ~Obviously, as the thing called 'life' goes first.~
@440  = ~Love, laughter, friendship, comfort, adventure, travel - yes, you are right.~
@441  = ~I don't know. I'd like to die.~
@442  = ~Your whining, for example.~
@443  = ~And with it go pleasures we barely tasted.~
@444  = ~(sigh) Yes, you have guessed my thoughts. I was thinking of traveling.~
@445  = ~This is a most un-elven desire. No, I certainly do not want to die.~
@446  = ~Worry not, you will be free of it very soon.~
@447  = ~While I do not grieve it will stop me from roaming the wilds in questionable company, I regret the impassable barrier it will erect between the true wonders of this world and myself. It is a pity that we are allowed to see so little in our short lifespans.~
@448  = ~Hey, whom did you call 'questionable company'?~
@449  = ~Yes, I would like to see Neverwinter, or travel to Icewind Dale.~
@450  = ~The Planes! Oh, I'd love to break away from the Prime!~
@451  = ~Never despair, Xan. We may see these wonders some day.~
@452  = ~And that is how it should be.~
@453  = ~Ah, so you think that your heritage makes you a desired addition to any adventuring party? No, <CHARNAME>, no, and it is not you alone. Your every companion bears a stigma of a sort. Were it not for your luck on the battlefield, they would have been long dead.~
@454  = ~Stigma or no, I trust them just the same.~
@455  = ~Perhaps you are right, but they have been useful so far.~
@456  = ~I shall not discuss my companions behind their backs.~
@457  = ~Companions? Where? It's just me and you here.~
@458  = ~What about you? You, too, are not the most reliable companion, are you?~
@459  = ~You are determined to see the best in people, I see. Well, it is not for me to disappoint you. But enough about this.~
@460  = ~You are making a mistake. Leaving dead weight in your group, or worse, a companion who will endanger you, provide you with false judgment or betray you, will not help matters. But enough about this.~
@461  = ~I understand. Let us drop the subject, then.~
@462  = ~Imoen, for one. But enough about this.~
@463  = ~(sigh) You have a sharp tongue. Perhaps... doomed as I am, I am not the best of companions. I cannot say that I enjoy you questioning my loyalty, however, so let us drop the subject, shall we?~
@464  = ~We were discussing travels, were we not?~
@465  = ~I would like to see Neverwinter, or travel to Icewind Dale.~
@466  = ~Once it is over, I hope to see the new places and the wonders you've been talking about.~
@467  = ~I am not interesting in simple traveling, to tell you the truth.~
@468  = ~Another dank hole of human civilisation. What beauty are you able to see there? I will never understand this.~
@469  = ~Traveling the Planes had been my dream for a long time, as well. It is good to know that you share this desire.~
@470  = ~It is not likely to happen, <CHARNAME>. I share your feelings, but... stop cherishing this false hope.~
@471  = ~I want to see the distant lands, however, forbidden or not. I never felt Evermeet's sun on my face, never walked other planes besides the Prime, and never saw Elven cities of old, even if they are but ruins today.~
@472  = ~You were shut in Candlekeep for all your youth, so your lack of traveling experience is understandable. For me, it is not. Evereska is renowned for its population of magic users and their knowledge of planar travel. From what I am aware of, a gate to Arvandor exists within the Tower of Dreams, and other gates link Evereska with Waterdeep and Silverymoon. So, the opportunities are many.~
@473  = ~What kept you from traveling, then?~
@474  = ~Citizens of Evereska must be lucky.~
@475  = ~Xan, I am tired of this talk. Let us move on.~
@476  = ~They are, but I am not.~
@477  = ~I was nearing your age in elven years when I claimed my moonblade, and from that moment on, I could no longer lapse into daydreams in the Academy of Magic, or sit under a tree with my spellbook, staring into space. I did not resent joining the Greycloaks; on the contrary, I was proud, but I had to give up what I treasured most - my dreams of walking the Planes and acquiring new knowledge.~
@478  = ~Er, Xan, is it you we are talking about? "We're all doomed?" "Life is so hollow?" Doesn't it ring a bell to you?~
@479  = ~Walking the Planes? But isn't it risky and dangerous? And don't you hate taking risks?~
@480  = ~I am sorry that it happened like that. Perhaps you'll yet have your dream.~
@481  = ~It was decades ago, and I changed since then, as you have mercilessly noted.~
@482  = ~I do not think so, but thank you.~
@483  = ~I do not dream of travels any longer. After the horrors I witnessed in peaceful settlements, I will probably never set foot outside this plane of existence, save Arvandor.~
@484  = ~Horrors? What horrors?~
@485  = ~Your loss. I, for one, intend to travel, as much as I can.~
@486  = ~<CHARNAME>! Spare me from this; our language does not even have the proper words. You are aware of the scope, I am sure. Men beating their children, the family's eldest, unable to fare for themselves, thrown out, women dying of exhaustion after birthing ten children in a row, the forests burned and plundered - no, I do not see any need to continue.~
@487  = ~If you defeat your siblings and ascend, it will be an impressive journey indeed. The only drawback is that it won't be you. Instead of the <CHARNAME> I know, a new deity of Murder will rise. And then, I'm afraid, you will have neither the time nor the inclination for traveling.~
@488  = ~But I will have time, Xan. All the time in the world.~
@489  = ~I am not going to become a deity. I'll remain a humble <CHARNAME>.~
@490  = ~Perhaps, but being a god is much more fun than some 'traveling'.~
@491  = ~Let us move on. (sigh) 'Travels' indeed... I do not know what came over me.~
@492  = ~I could remind you that being a live mortal is more rewarding than being killed by Lolth or Cyric minutes after your ascension, but what would be the point?~
@493  = ~But will you have a choice? I do not see how a mortal may escape the destiny that has been laid for <HIMHER> by Ao himself, and confirmed by Alaundo soon after.~
@494  = ~What do you know of magic?~ [O#XAN058]
@495  = ~A fair bit.~
@496  = ~Hello? I am a mage, actually.~
@497  = ~Not that you notice, but I can do spells, too, y'know?~
@498  = ~I know that my magic is far superior to yours.~
@499  = ~I am not practicing it, as you can see.~
@500  = ~Why do you ask? Do you want to teach me some?~
@501  = ~Not much.~
@502  = ~Sorry, Xan, but I am not interested.~
@503  = ~You are not interested in learning about the forces that keep you alive? Typical. With a leader like you, we're all doomed.~
@504  = ~To teach you, the Greatest Bhaalspawn? Learn from you, more like. You have mastered the Art much faster than anyone would have believed, let alone faster than me. No, it was the nature of your skill that I want to talk to you about - the Weave.~
@505  = ~You call yourself a mage, but are you aware of what it means?~
@506  = ~"Where Art is life, Lore is thought, and Song is beauty?" But you are aware of Eltargrim's words, surely. Yes, you have captured the Song, conquered the Lore, but have you mastered the Art?~
@507  = ~You shape the energies the way I will never be able to do, that much is true. But do you know why, and how?~
@508  = ~Indeed? You have no connection to magic, and you claim to know its nature? You, who knows nearly nothing?~
@509  = ~No, you know nothing.~
@510  = ~Of course I do! Before a wizard can cast a spell, he must memorize its formula. This locks an energy pattern into his mind. Upon casting, the energy of the spell is wiped from the wizard's mind. The wizard cannot re-cast this spell, until he memorizes it again!~
@511  = ~What should I know of, Xan? The Weave? Yes, I am aware of a conduit that allows us mortals to draw upon the power of magic through it.~
@512  = ~No, oh Mighty One, I do not! Grace me with your wisdom, I beg of you!~
@513  = ~I am aware of what magic is, mellonamin. It rings in my soul. Magic is not merely a pawn or a force to manipulate at will and whim, for to do so is to invite disaster. Magic is not power; magic simply is.~
@514  = ~Very impressive. You have learned "The Wizard's Handbook" by heart, I believe?~
@515  = ~You have heard of it, and yet you do not understand it. The Weave is not only a source of power that you so callously keep tapping.~
@516  = ~That was what the Academy teacher said to me and the other initiates on our first day there. You see the truth of things, my friend.~
@517  = ~It is not a tool, but a living force which demands respect and reverence. Have you seen the zeal the druids display when defending their forests? One cannot become a druid and remain dispassionate to Nature. One cannot become a true mage without passion, for only in emotion it becomes Art. Magic is the lifeblood of this world, as everpresent as life itself. Don't you see it?~
@518  = ~I never heard you talking like this. You even look different.~
@519  = ~I must have read it somewhere, but I thought these were only words.~
@520  = ~But what is the difference?~
@521  = ~Yes, I...~
@522  = ~Now I understand why mages rarely feel the need to marry. Why, you, for example, love your magic more than anybody else!~
@523  = ~He-he, gotcha! You are as pink as Imoen's hair!~
@524  = ~Never mind. Continue, Xan.~
@525  = ~(sigh) <CHARNAME>, you and your jibes...~
@526  = ~How can you call them mere words? You are a practitioner of the Art, much as myself. If robbed of your special connection with the Weave, you will die like a fish pulled out of the water. If you remember, the entire elven population of Toril was nearly wiped out when Karsus tried to take Mystra's place.~
@527  = ~Once you start regarding magic like I do, you will feel it.~
@528  = ~But you live in a world enveloped by magic. Surely you wondered about its nature? Or do you live in a world of hurled stones and clashing blades, and believe that mages are deranged individuals, who wear skirts and are mortally afraid of cold steel?~
@529  = ~I never said anything of the sort! Stop twisting my words!~
@530  = ~Yes, I wondered.~
@531  = ~I don't care, really. Mages are useful, and that's all there is to it.~
@532  = ~Ah... I apologize if it came as an attack, but I witnessed this attitude far too often, so I could not help but view you with suspicion. Again, I am sorry. Are you still interested?~
@533  = ~Yes, please, continue.~
@534  = ~No, I'd rather be left alone.~
@535  = ~Very well.~
@536  = ~Most mages memorize a fireball or two, and have done with it. But they could be so much more if they felt true affinity with the Weave, if they put their heart into spellcasting, instead of simply mastering the utility.~
@537  = ~Magic... it has a living soul behind it, so abusing the Weave, sapping its power and giving naught of yourself in return, may have dire consequences. N'Tel'Quess, non-elves, do not understand it, obviously. I almost wish that elves had not taught humans magic centuries ago. Then we could have avoided the fall of the Netherese empire and many other dangerous happenings which tainted the Weave forever.~
@538  = ~Alas, it has already happened, mellonamin.~
@539  = ~Could you tell me more of the Weave?~
@540  = ~So, you have to love the Weave? Is that all there is to it?~
@541  = ~Alas, you are right. But while our people wield High Magic, there is still hope for our survival.~
@542  = ~No, my curious friend, it is not. One does not 'love' the Art in the most primitive sense of the word, the one that regular patrons of the Copper Coronet are so fond of using. No, when I say 'feeling true affinity', I mean not only devotion and reverence, but also lengthy studies and deep understanding.~
@543  = ~The Weave literally holds the world together, and we elves, too, play a role in maintaining it: Arselu'Tel'Quess, Elven High Magic. Aside from the selected few, we know very little of it, and of what I know, I am forbidden to speak even to you. But know this: if not for my brethren, Faerun would have collapsed long ago, for the Weave cannot maintain itself fully, and humans cannot ignore the immediate to see the inevitable.~
@544  = ~It seems to me that elves use the Weave to achieve their own goals.~
@545  = ~It sounds like a noble deed. You are a moonblade wielder, why don't you join?~
@546  = ~Interesting. It is a pity that you cannot tell me more.~
@547  = ~Not 'their' goals, <CHARNAME>. 'Our' goals. That is the first and foremost rule of Elven Magic - it relies on trust and sharing, unlike the human variation, where everyone is fending for themselves. A mage uses High Magic for the betterment of all, not his own benefit.~
@548  = ~But you have learned of magic from humans, and probably do not understand. Let us continue on.~
@549  = ~I... I wanted to, yes. However, due to Mulahey's intervention a year ago and my subsequent capture, I will never be able to join the High Mages' ranks, even if I live to reach the appropriate age.~
@550  = ~I can only tell you the part that concerns myself, though I warn you, it is a tedious one.~
@551  = ~Please do.~
@552  = ~Then do not tell me.~
@553  = ~To prevent the abuse of High Magic, a certain understanding of our ways is needed, as well as a considerable level of maturity. Thus, only old, experienced and wise may enter this path.~
@554  = ~When I learned of this, I was content, as I did not feel worthy as of yet, and hoped that another hundred years would give me more insight. But alas, it did not happen as such...~
@555  = ~After you had freed me from the depths of the Nashkel mines, I was hiding fever for days. The damp cave where I had spent five and eighty days did nothing to improve my health, and since my return to Evereska, I had to while away months under the healers' care. I would not complain but for one reason: the candidate willing to embrace High Magic must be of far sounder health than a traditional wizard. I am not.~
@556  = ~What can I say? I am sorry.~
@557  = ~Look at it this way: it could be worse. If not for your previous capture, you would be taking part in some weird and dangerous rituals even now!~
@558  = ~Couldn't you restore your health by magic?~
@559  = ~Thank you. These are simple words, but they help. They do.~
@560  = ~<CHARNAME>, you were not paying attention. Only those who reach the age of four hundred and fifty summers may be found worthy, and it will do the supplicant no good to be impatient. Besides, the dangers we face now are much the same for the person of my ability as the protection of the Weave is for the wizard of Elminster's caliber.~
@561  = ~Short of a miracle, I know of no remedy. No, it is futile.~
@562  = ~But I have rambled about myself so long that you probably want to strangle me now. And you will be right. If I may, I would like to talk about you next time.~
@563  = ~There is a question I have long wanted to ask. What happened to your mother? You never told me; is it because you do not know yourself?~ [O#XAN059]
@564  = ~She is dead, and that is all you need to know.~
@565  = ~Gorion left me a letter in his room at Candlekeep. She was his former lover, raped by Bhaal, and she died giving birth to me.~
@566  = ~I have no idea. She may still be alive.~
@567  = ~My mother? Was that your idea of talking about me?~
@568  = ~You cannot deny that it is important for you. If you do not know your past, how can you claim that you know yourself?~
@569  = ~I understand... and I am sorry for reminding you of it. Though it is probable that we will join her soon - a poorer consolation, still.~
@570  = ~(shudder) A grievous fate. It makes me relieved that I am not a woman, and the Time of Troubles is long past.~
@571  = ~It is possible that your foster father knew something about her. Alas, he is dead, and the chance to find her is hopelessly lost.~
@572  = ~Who could she be, the mysterious woman who brought you to this world? Another member of a benevolent organization, much like Gorion? An unfortunate girl who took a false step once and became a priestess of Bhaal? Or just a victim of circumstances?~
@573  = ~Gorion knew her well, so she must have been a Harper, like him.~
@574  = ~My mother, a priestess of Bhaal? Xan, you scare me.~
@575  = ~A priestess of Bhaal? Then I am truly the Chosen One, destined to rule in the stead of my father!~
@576  = ~I feel sorry for her, whoever she was.~
@577  = ~I know it sounds reassuring to you, but to me it does not bode well. With both your foster father and your birth mother being Harpers, Elminster, 'accidentally' dropping by every couple of days, and Gorion's friends, Khalid and Jaheira, watching over you, your birth could be a part of some Harper plan.~
@578  = ~Am I only a tool, then? A Harper's blade, forged against other Bhaalspawn?~
@579  = ~I have been thinking about it, too, but I refuse to believe it. Gorion loved me, and he would have never used me in such a cold and calculating manner.~
@580  = ~I never trusted Gorion, and now I have an explanation! The old trickster! I am not to be manipulated!~
@581  = ~In a way, perhaps. Still, your fate was better than your unfortunate brother's.~
@582  = ~You have your reasons to trust Gorion, I am sure. But remember, he had been concealing your true heritage from you for decades. What if it was not the only thing he kept secret? You cannot close your eyes to the possibility.~
@583  = ~You may find consolation in the fact that he is now dead, and you are free to forge your destiny yourself. But don't you have a tiniest flicker of gratitude for a man who gave you shelter and education?~
@584  = ~No. He had been using me all the way, and nothing else matters.~
@585  = ~I suppose I do, but it is still difficult to forgive him.~
@586  = ~Even the fact that he gave his life, so you might live? But have it your way.~
@587  = ~With understanding comes forgiveness, they say.~
@588  = ~It is only a possibility. I see why you are so distraught, however: Bhaal's priesthood is not famed for kindness and generosity. A ritual murder once a tenday, another murder after each increase in rank, and a dogma of their church stating that all things must die - more than enough to be uneasy. But you probably know all this, having grown up at Candlekeep.~
@589  = ~I very much doubt it. More likely, both your mother and your sire planned to use you for a ritual sacrifice. Bhaalists, or, rather, Deathstalkers, the priesthood working on Bhaal's resurrection, are famed for their blind devotion to their patron. But you probably know all this, having grown up at Candlekeep.~
@590  = ~I was more fortunate than you, since I had a normal family and loving parents. Alas, all good things are destined to dust. Some retreated to Evermeet, my cousin Erevain Blacksheaf died in some pathetic brawl, and my parents left this world. I hope to join them eventually, but the way our misadventure is going, I will die in the clutches of the undead or worse, forever denied the Eternal Plane.~
@591  = ~I am sorry, Xan. How did your parents die?~
@592  = ~Well, at least you do not have Bhaal for a daddy.~
@593  = ~The Eternal Plane?~
@594  = ~It is futile for a moonblade wielder to hope for a long and fruitful life, and my sire was no exception. He had died on a mission a long time ago, and my mother had spent her spirit in hopeless longing and died of grief not a year thereafter. (sigh) At least I have the consolation that they will reunite in Arvandor, and that nobody will mourn me after I pass away.~
@595  = ~You must be happy that they are... wherever they are.~
@596  = ~It is still better than being Bhaal's little <GIRLBOY>.~
@597  = ~You are wrong, Xan. I will grieve if you die.~
@598  = ~I would not speak of your heritage so lightly. It has secured your doom already; do not impede it.~
@599  = ~Arvanaith means 'heaven' in High Elven. It is a part of the Plane of Arvandor, to where all elves make their last journey, with rare exceptions.~
@600  = ~But why speak of heaven among ashes and rags? Let us proceed; I do not think I can stand it if we speak of it further.~
@601  = ~Another hope lost. (sigh) But you are a Bhaalspawn, doomed to dust in the name of your father, so your sorrow will be short.~
@602  = ~You continue on your path, regardless of any who would hinder you. I cannot help but admire your dedication, whereas I... but never mind.~ [O#XAN060]
@603  = ~All right, I won't.~
@604  = ~Stop stammering, elf, spit it out!~
@605  = ~What were you going to say?~
@606  = ~Very well, but if you need my ear, I will be glad to help.~
@607  = ~It is of no importance, anyway. The question was an idle one.~
@608  = ~Truly? Yes, you can indeed help. Two things lie heavily on my mind, and while you can do nothing about the first one - my doubts of whether I am needed in Evereska, the second one you have power to reassure me about.~
@609  = ~Of course, what is it?~
@610  = ~Such a long premise... I've got a bad feeling about this.~
@611  = ~On second thought, I do not think I wish to discuss it.~
@612  = ~What is your intent? You pursue Irenicus at the moment, but what are you going to do once you defeat him? Our fates are linked together for now, so when you plunge into another affair, you endanger my life, as well. If I stay with you after Irenicus is defeated, how far on the scale between 'life-threatening' and 'suicidal' should I expect our ventures to be?~
@613  = ~And that is all? I thought you were going to ask something serious!~
@614  = ~Very dangerous, I think. Once I kill Irenicus, I am going to fight with my other siblings for the Throne of Bhaal.~
@615  = ~I hope to retire from adventuring, actually. At least, for a while.~
@616  = ~Fighting dragons, blowing up liches, treasure hunting - the usual.~
@617  = ~What can be more serious than my own safety? <CHARNAME>, you are my friend, but you flatter yourself if you think I am going to follow you whatever the cost.~
@618  = ~You know of Alaundo's prophecies, don't you? Then you should know that I am going to fight for Bhaal's legacy, which is rightfully mine.~
@619  = ~Our future travels will be quite dangerous, but not more than they are now, I think.~
@620  = ~After Irenicus is defeated, I want to lead a sheltered, quiet life.~
@621  = ~Then, <CHARNAME>, I will not join the ranks of your allies. Mass slaughter in the name of your ascension is not to my taste at all.~
@622  = ~Don't we all? But I'm afraid you will be hard pressed to step out into the open, for various reasons. Already you and your ilk are viewed with suspicion, and the Council of Six doubtlessly keeps an eye on you. What will happen if you return with Irenicus' head on a pike, proud and triumphant? And of course, there is the matter of your siblings.~
@623  = ~Which effectively reduces our life expectancy to several hours, I presume. However, there is another factor which might play its role - your siblings.~
@624  = ~What if they start the war Alaundo has foreseen? Willing or not, you will have to enter the competition for the Throne of Bhaal, and your companions will be drawn into the fray, as well. And then I will have to leave your company. Mass slaughter in the name of your ascension is not to my taste at all.~
@625  = ~I give you my word, Xan: I will not fight for Bhaal's legacy.~
@626  = ~I hope to be left alone. But if not, I will do what I must.~
@627  = ~I will claim my heritage, then, and woe to anyone who dares to oppose me!~
@628  = ~Let us just wait and see what happens. It is too early to speculate.~
@629  = ~I believe you. But what will happen when you are forced to? (sigh) Let us just move on.~
@630  = ~You certainly have the gift of finding the right words. But will they help when you are confronted with the inevitable? (sigh) Let us just move on.~
@631  = ~I see that it has already begun.~
@632  = ~When it starts, it will already be too late. But as you wish.~
@633  = ~You are well-versed in hoodwinking. Why, I started to trust you implicitly, forgetting what a destructive entity you are. But the trail of bodies you leave in your wake is not easy to overlook.~ [O#XAN061]
@634  = ~Yes, I sort of wondered when we'd come to this.~
@635  = ~Again? Xan, shut up.~
@636  = ~Ah, good old "Giving in to the Evil Taint versus Steeling Yourself for the Trials to Come."~
@637  = ~What brings this on?~
@638  = ~It is inevitable. We are steered by your destiny, so we cannot avoid speaking of it.~
@639  = ~I shall not address you again.~
@640  = ~I bow to your wit. But I was going to speak of more serious things.~
@641  = ~Ever since you left Candlekeep, people around you started to die in numbers. The bounty hunters and Sarevok's bandits got their due, I suppose. But what about members of the Flaming Fist, who honestly followed their orders? What about citizens of Candlekeep, mutilated by doppelgangers? What about some of your former companions? They are all dead, and their only fault was meeting you. It can only grow worse, and I want no part of it.~
@642  = ~You are already assisting me, whether you want to or not.~
@643  = ~Then you are free to go, as is everyone who travels with me.~
@644  = ~What can I do about it, Xan? Stop being a Bhaalspawn? This is my nature.~
@645  = ~But it is not my fault! I was doing whatever I could to protect these people!~
@646  = ~True, but a few accidental deaths make no difference. When things are moving to the larger scale, however, to assist you is to hasten the doom of Toril.~
@647  = ~I do not intend to do it just yet, but I am about to. Only your desperate situation stops me short of leaving: abandoning you now would be a betrayal of the worst sort. Still, I feel I am hastening the doom of Toril.~
@648  = ~It is indeed. I have tried to overlook it for some time, but I feel that to assist you is to hasten the doom of Toril.~
@649  = ~It was not your intent to harm them, but it was your fault, regardless. Willing or not, you are growing into your heritage... and hastening the doom of Toril.~
@650  = ~Have you read Alaundo's prophecies? "The spawn of the Lord of Murder are fated to come into their inheritance through bloodshed and misery." And another one: "When the Beast's bastard children come of age, they will bring havoc to the lands of the Sword Coast." Whether good or evil, whether benevolent or malicious, you and your siblings carry death within.~
@651  = ~I can only hope you have not come of age yet, since Irenicus managed to capture you so easily. Once you have dealt with the madman, however, the massacre will begin. And I, as I said, will leave.~
@652  = ~Leave? Or will you raise your arms against me?~
@653  = ~I understand, Xan. I do not like it, but I understand.~
@654  = ~But I need your assistance and counsel! What am I to do without your help?~
@655  = ~I was born to stop this massacre, not to take the lead in it. Stay with me, and we shall stop it together.~
@656  = ~Do you believe I could? No, I will not be able to strike a blow against a <MANWOMAN> I consider a friend. Never.~
@657  = ~Let us go, <CHARNAME>. I do not wish to provoke further hostility from you.~
@658  = ~Thank you.~
@659  = ~Oh, you will fare well, I am sure. I almost wish you would not, but then your other siblings will take your place, and the wave of destruction will rise even higher. You are at least a known quantity.~
@660  = ~It is just another illusion. You cannot stop your true destiny from fulfilling, just as you cannot bring back those who have already died.~
@661  = ~Forgive me, my friend. You are a decent person, despite your heritage, and it was unfair of me to berate you. I am sorry to have caused offense.~ [O#XAN062]
@662  = ~It's all right, you have not.~
@663  = ~Yes, yes, I forgive you. Let's just continue on, shall we?~
@664  = ~Forget it. I am not interested in talking to you any longer.~
@665  = ~But I have, and I want to apologize properly.~
@666  = ~Thank you. I want to express my gratitude to you, however: for everything, except dragging me off to these risky crusades of yours.~
@667  = ~(sigh) As you wish.~
@668  = ~I look back to the past days, and I realize that I owe you a huge debt that can never be repaid, a debt of friendship. Listening is a rare gift, and I accept it thankfully.~
@669  = ~Now my ears are flaming red.~
@670  = ~Yes, but let's continue on, already! In silence, if you please.~
@671  = ~I wish to thank you, too. You've been a good friend to me all the way.~
@672  = ~Don't mention it.~
@673  = ~No, it is I who feels ridiculous. But making a fool of myself is a specialty of mine.~
@674  = ~Of course, mellonamin. Thank you again.~
@675  = ~Was I?~
@676  = ~Of course you were! Who else would constantly remind me that we're all doomed in such an unforgettable manner!~
@677  = ~Yes, you were a good listener, too.~
@678  = ~On second thought, no. I could say the same about every decent man I came across.~
@679  = ~(sigh) That does not change the fact that we *are* doomed, as you well know.~
@680  = ~It was different with me. You listened of your own volition, while I never had a choice: I had to cling to your every word, to determine who you were - a murderous Spawn of Bhaal, or a <PRO_MANWOMAN> to trust.~
@681  = ~Really? And what have you concluded?~
@682  = ~But I am a Spawn of Bhaal.~
@683  = ~Do you trust me, Xan?~
@684  = ~Being thought of as a decent <PRO_MANWOMAN> is much already.~
@685  = ~You are. One does not exclude the other, however.~
@686  = ~As I said, you are a decent person, and I trust you to some extent, but you are still a Spawn of Bhaal. And thus, the time of our travels together grows short. Soon, you will have to enter the path of the divine, and I will return to Evereska. Or die, more likely.~
@687  = ~Was it a pre-emptive farewell?~
@688  = ~It was a pleasure traveling with you. But you are not departing yet, I trust?~
@689  = ~Stubborn elf, does nothing I say have any effect on you? You do not have to leave!~
@690  = ~It was. It can well happen that I will not have a chance to say these words to you, seeing that being torn apart by monsters or getting a head chopped off effectively prevents one from speaking. So, I am saying my farewells now.~
@691  = ~No, I am not. But it can well happen that I will not have a chance to say these words to you, seeing that being torn apart by monsters or getting a head chopped off effectively prevents one from speaking. So, I am saying my farewells now.~
@692  = ~I do. It is not just a whim of mine, and neither are my beliefs the only cause: I am also a moonblade wielder. Have you forgotten this?~
@693  = ~Yes, you have a moonblade. So what?~
@694  = ~And the power of the blade will kill you, should you make a wrong decision?~
@695  = ~What, a high and mighty moonblade wielder will not dirty his noble hands to help a Bhaalspawn side-kick of his?~
@696  = ~How ignorant can you get? Moonblades have power of their own, power which would kill me, should I make a wrong step.~
@697  = ~It is very possible.~
@698  = ~You are a fool, <CHARNAME>, and worse, one with disregard for the feelings of others.~
@699  = ~If I go, against my own judgment, if I come with you, knowing full well that it can only bring more death and suffering, the blade will either kill me or become dormant - a terrible shame for every surviving member of my House. I will not stand for this.~
@700  = ~But I have said all I wanted to say. Let us move on.~
@701  = ~Not only does death accompany us in our travels, but we must be ready at all hours to awake and heed her call.~ [O#XAN063]
@702  = ~For once in my life, I would like to abide by my own wishes. Shall we stay here? Or do you feel the pressing need to march on?~
@703  = ~Hmm... what? No, don't disturb me, I am having a well-deserved REST!~
@704  = ~Staying here is a good idea.~
@705  = ~I am sorry, but we have to move on.~
@706  = ~We are marching out. Now!~
@707  = ~Yes, I am rather tired, too.~
@708  = ~Do we have to? Oh, well, if you insist...~
@709  = ~I could not agree more. Why work to meet death, when you can achieve the same result without effort?~
@710  = ~As you command, my inflexible leader, so it will be. (sigh) Let us move on.~
@711  = ~Though what would be the point? If we stay, we will be ambushed and killed in our sleep. If we march out, we will perish in battle. Seldarine knows which death is better.~
@712  = ~Does the notion that we will not die ever come into your head?~
@713  = ~I prefer to meet death rested. We are staying here.~
@714  = ~To die now or later - the eternal question.~
@715  = ~Gods, will you stop chattering? Pick your pack, and let's go!~
@716  = ~Death is inevitable. Sooner or later, you will understand it. Or do you already? How many people have you met and not killed?~
@717  = ~Many. I am a peaceful person, actually.~
@718  = ~It means that their death is inevitable. Not mine.~
@719  = ~(yawn) Do continue. I'll just close my eyes for a short while...~
@720  = ~Right. I am death incarnate. But now we really have to go.~
@721  = ~Oh, yes, you are an epitome of peacefulness. Especially after killing a goblin or two.~
@722  = ~(sigh) Let us go. There is no point in delaying the inevitable.~
@723  = ~I fear that the day your murderous tendencies win, I will become one of 'them'.~
@724  = ~Never mind. We are alive now, and that is what matters. Let us go.~
@725  = ~Excuse me for disturbing you as you prepare our luxurious lodgings, but has it occurred to you that there is an inn just around the corner? Or do you prefer the free service of cut-your-throat-as-you-sleep to the moderate fee for a roof over your head?~ [O#XAN064]
@726  = ~Look who is talking! Weren't you robbed in the Copper Coronet on your first night in Athkatla?~
@727  = ~We need rest, and we need it now. So no inn.~
@728  = ~Oh, all right. Let's go find one.~
@729  = ~If you think that spending a night in the streets of the city swarming with thieves will less likely get you robbed than sleeping indoors, by all means, go ahead. I am going to an inn.~
@730  = ~You will stop right here! I am your leader, and I am saying: no inn!~
@731  = ~Wait, I'm coming with you!~
@732  = ~And where will you take the money, pray tell? I am not going to loan you any.~
@733  = ~Go ahead. Just don't blame me when you return here in the morning, and I am gone.~
@734  = ~I did warn you. If an Amnish soldier or a drunkard decides to tickle you with his pike or pick your pockets, it will be entirely your fault.~
@735  = ~Yes, my fault! Now Let. Me. Have. My. Rest.~
@736  = ~Xan, I am tired. Just go away.~
@737  = ~All right, all right. Now, where is this inn?~
@738  = ~Over there, though now I'm afraid they will not have any rooms to rent. Just our bad luck...~
@739  = ~Those the gods want to destroy, they first make to sleep in the streets...~
@740  = ~You are as stubborn as an Amnish official. Have it your way, then. But if we do not wake up in the morning, it will be entirely your fault.~
@741  = ~Yes, my fault! Now Let. Me. Have. My. Rest!~
@742  = ~As if we were not in enough trouble already, you would go and get yourself drunk. Typical. Do you have enough wits to get to your room quietly, and not pick a fight at the stairs?~ [O#XAN065]
@743  = ~G-geroff me! Who are you, my mother?~
@744  = ~Wh-what room? We are going ad-dventuring! Right now!~
@745  = ~Room. Right. Left foot, right foot, left foot, right foot...~
@746  = ~Fight? Sounds like a superb idea! Hey, you! Yes, YOU, over there! Whatcha looking at?~
@747  = ~Not trouble, old boy! Say, dr-drink this one (hic!) with me, willya?~
@748  = ~No, your traveling companion, who forebodes that we shall not journey together for long. Look at yourself: you can barely stand!~
@749  = ~Do forgive me, but the glorious quest to become a corpse, or, in your case, a pile of dust, does not attract me in the slightest.~
@750  = ~Seldarine, why do I travel with this drunkard? It is pointless, for <HESHE> is surely doomed.~
@751  = ~Stop waving to the bar stand, <CHARNAME>! You have my word that there is nobody there.~
@752  = ~No, thank you. You seem in no condition to be a pleasant companion; rather, a life-threatening one.~
@753  = ~Rent a room, and sleep overnight. If you do not, I doubt we'll live another hour, as you will likely get your head chopped off.~
@754  = ~N-n-nonsense! I am a Bhaalspawn! I am innnvinnnnncible!~
@755  = ~Nope, we h-have to g-go! We have a v-very urrrrrgent quest! Onwards!~
@756  = ~All right, all right, I'm g-going...~
@757  = ~So invincible that Irenicus captured you in a blink of an eye?~
@758  = ~Yesssssss! Now geroff me!~
@759  = ~I guess not. (hic!) I'll go to bed.~
@760  = ~It is hopeless. We shall be killed. We shall be surrounded, maimed and murdered, and our corpses shall be mutilated beyond recognition.~
@761  = ~But you cannot fight your destiny, I suppose.~
@762  = ~So, this is the place where it happened.~ [O#XAN066]
@763  = ~Yes. Irenicus stood on that heap of rubble and kept blasting the Cowled Wizards to smithereens. Then Imoen stepped forward and shouted at him. But he simply waved her away, as if she was a fly. He would have killed the Cowlies, too, but there were too many of them.~
@764  = ~Easy to recognize, isn't it? Yes, Irenicus left quite a mess here. Shadow Thieves tried to overwhelm him, but he waved once, waved again, and they were gone. Dead.~
@765  = ~It is. And deep below is Irenicus' lair, where he kept us in cages.~
@766  = ~Yes, but I do not want to talk about it.~
@767  = ~You were fortunate they arrived. Were they delayed, you could have been returned to the dungeon you barely escaped, or worse, you could have been killed for your disobedience.~
@768  = ~I don't think he would have killed us. He wanted to 'examine my potential', and he was interested in Imoen, as well. He needed his test subjects.~
@769  = ~I think Irenicus wanted to be taken by Cowlies. "You may take me in, but you will take the girl, as well," he said. Now I understand it was a trap.~
@770  = ~The bastard could have done that, I guess. We were lucky.~
@771  = ~How had the Shadow Thieves hoped to overwhelm him? They must have understood they had no chance. Besides, didn't you say that you were captured by assassins? At one point, Shadow Thieves worked for him, not tried to kill him, it seems.~
@772  = ~I don't think so. Shadow Thieves are not the epitome of morality, but they have standards.~
@773  = ~Irenicus could have hired some thugs to capture me. I don't believe they were Shadow Thieves.~
@774  = ~It could be. And then, they had a disagreement, possibly about that rival guild... and we met a vampire, fighting Shadow Thieves, underground...~
@775  = ~I am sorry to hear this. It is not an experience to be forgotten, I am sure. Though perhaps it will be easier to bear, once you have killed your adversary... (sigh) Seldarine, what am I saying? It is a doomed endeavour.~
@776  = ~How did you escape Irenicus' clutches at all, if I may ask?~
@777  = ~Cowled Wizards charged Irenicus with illegal use of magic and forced him to surrender. Unlicensed magic is banned in Athkatla, as you recall.~
@778  = ~Shadow Thieves helped us somewhat. They ambushed his lair, and in the confusion I managed to escape.~
@779  = ~It was very unpleasant, Xan. I'd rather not relive it.~
@780  = ~Quite understandable. Let us move on away from the place: I cannot say it does not affect me, either.~
@781  = ~Thieves, who trade in slaves, practice torture, robberies and assassination, have standards? You need to have your head examined, I fear.~
@782  = ~It could be. But why hire thugs, when he had a powerful organization so close? Ah, but we shall never know the truth.~
@783  = ~It is a sound theory, I suppose, even if we shall never know the truth.~
@784  = ~It is a frightening thought. Treating sentient beings as things... it is a most un-elven behavior.~
@785  = ~I doubt it. He was overwhelmed, and tried to use the situation to his advantage. But you know better than I, I am sure.~
@786  = ~You were indeed.~
@787  = ~(sigh) Let us move on, <CHARNAME>. Away from this place.~
@788  = ~Here is life in earnest, without a feeble pretense of beauty. Dirt, slime and darkness.~ [O#XAN067]
@789  = ~And smell.~
@790  = ~What of Evereska? Is it only a feeble pretense, too?~
@791  = ~Ever pessimistic, are you?~
@792  = ~It is beautiful.~
@793  = ~(groan) <CHARNAME>, don't. Just don't.~
@794  = ~Evereska... Evereska is beautiful. But no, I will not describe it here. It will only cheapen the memory of it, the most precious thing I carry with me.~
@795  = ~Ever hopeful, are you? I have no reasons to think otherwise, <CHARNAME>.~
@796  = ~Of course, the Bhaalspawn must have their own sense of aesthetics.~
@797  = ~To think of it, my whole life had been a series of dank and damp holes. It is incredible that somewhere far north there are feasts, and music, and laughter. We are in a privileged position, however: our deaths will be less bitter, while those enjoying life will be dying in regret. Or should I envy them? I do not know.~
@798  = ~You should. Imagine: a fair maiden dancing upon the dewed grass, a flask of wine in your hand, faint music coming from the windows, your friends' laughter in the distance - isn't it worth living for?~
@799  = ~One day, there will be feasts, music and laughter for us, too.~
@800  = ~Hey, we'll become rich and powerful really soon! Then we'll see who will envy whom.~
@801  = ~Theirs is life, and ours is a grim, pathetic existence.~
@802  = ~Ironically, for me it is only worth dying for.~
@803  = ~Where? In heaven? In Arvandor? We will die long before I will sheathe my sword and close my spellbook. It is pointless to dream of fleeting shadows.~
@804  = ~You were born to it, but I chose it myself.~
@805  = ~I often wonder, is the hidden purpose of the moonblades to exile capable mages from the elven citadels? We are honored, young fools look at the remaining blades with reverence and dream of dying for Elvendom, but do they know what it means? To crawl the gutters and look at your own intestines at times? And I do not have the heart to regret it: duty seeped into my bones.~
@806  = ~You are still better off than me. At least, people respect you for what you are.~
@807  = ~Would you rather be a Bhaalspawn?~
@808  = ~Why did you choose such a destiny? Did you want honor, too?~
@809  = ~Too bad. Well, if you're finished, we've more gutters to crawl.~
@810  = ~For all it is worth, I am sorry.~
@811  = ~You had suffered more than I, this I know. No matter: we shall die in the same hour.~
@812  = ~I wanted to help, <CHARNAME>. To help my poor kin, to stop the pillaging of our lands, to - ~
@813  = ~No, I am lying to you. I was not thinking of anything in particular: the grief from my father's death was too great.~
@814  = ~An hour ago, I wanted to leave the Copper Coronet more than anything else. I should have been careful with my wishes: now all I want is to walk its floors again.~
@815  = ~One doomed man comforts another. Isn't it ironic?~
@816  = ~Slime. Slime and grime. But I should not start complaining again, I suppose. Lead on.~
@817  = ~Have you thought well? Are you intent on pursuing Irenicus?~ [O#XAN068]
@818  = ~Of course. He hurt me, and he will pay.~
@819  = ~Imoen is there! Should I abandon her to torture and death?~
@820  = ~He knows of a way for me to gain power. I need it.~
@821  = ~Believe me, Xan, I do not want to.~
@822  = ~Why do you ask? You have not questioned my judgment before.~
@823  = ~I have doubts as to who will pay in this case. Your overconfidence is dangerous and may lead to your demise - and mine.~
@824  = ~I did not imply you should. But I was not talking about Imoen. I was speaking of yourself.~
@825  = ~Of course, of course. Irenicus will stand at the gates of your destination with his hands outstretched, offering you power, eternal bliss and magical treasure of the highest quality.~
@826  = ~It will not happen. Rather, you will become a source of his own power.~
@827  = ~But you must... Your choice to seek them out is sensible, but...~
@828  = ~I've been tempted to do so a few times, but you've managed to get us out of each and every tight spot. However, this decision is far too serious.~
@829  = ~I fear that you are not powerful enough to withstand Irenicus' might. Shadow Thieves or their rivals may secure passage for us, but will they help us eliminate him? Are we able to destroy him ourselves? Wait and think, before you rush into action.~
@830  = ~No, Xan. I need to free Imoen as soon as possible.~
@831  = ~But we have already performed all possible tasks for the whole of Athkatla and her surroundings!~
@832  = ~Perhaps you are right. But I'd like to know what they have to say.~
@833  = ~Right. Thieves, Imoen, Irenicus - who needs them? Let's go adventuring!~
@834  = ~I have not decided with whom I should attempt to ally, yet. Any advice?~
@835  = ~I would not worry for her, yet. If Irenicus uses her as bait, he will not dispose of her before you arrive. Though, knowing most madmen's unpredictable nature, he just might.~
@836  = ~Did we? Funnily enough, I do not consider myself Irenicus' rival, yet. Perhaps you'll find some safe, boring, and above all, long mission for us to carry out?~
@837  = ~(sigh) You will not, I see. Go ahead, then.~
@838  = ~Well, if you see no alternative... See them, if you must, but be wary.~
@839  = ~Adventuring? Seldarine, not again! And to think that I myself have proposed it...~
@840  = ~All I can repeat to you is my peer's advice: avoid undead and unnatural at all costs. This way, you will survive. Otherwise, you will not.~
@841  = ~This... this building is dread impersonated. By the look of it, I would say that both your friend and your enemy are now dead. No sentient being can survive here.~ [O#XAN069]
@842  = ~Yes, it looks rather creepy.~
@843  = ~Imoen... how is she? We must hurry!~
@844  = ~It's not that bad. I'd like to have it as my stronghold, actually.~
@845  = ~Irenicus will survive anywhere. He is too powerful to be a mere prisoner.~
@846  = ~And to think that we shall enter it in a moment. We must prepare well.~
@847  = ~Wait, <CHARNAME>. You will see your Imoen soon, but do you know what you are going to do?~
@848  = ~Indeed? The Cowled Wizards will be delighted to hand it over to you for free, I assume.~
@849  = ~There are hundreds of them inside. We must prepare well.~
@850  = ~Yes, he might be alive, and it makes the place doubly dangerous.~
@851  = ~What is your plan? Shall we bang through the front doors? Make ourselves invisible? Prepare for an assault? For treachery?~
@852  = ~We'll run in, weapons at the ready, and woe to anyone who dares to stand in my way!~
@853  = ~We must proceed carefully. Nobody knows what can meet us there - or who.~
@854  = ~Imoen's safety is my foremost goal. We'll need to get to her as soon as possible.~
@855  = ~Irenicus shall not withstand our magic. We will win.~
@856  = ~Irenicus' magic is no match for my sword arm. We shall win.~
@857  = ~I shall quietly creep in, and you shall stay at the entrance.~
@858  = ~So if there is a trap at the entrance, you will be the one to trigger it. Very well, let's run, as you say. Run into the darkness. Once you get yourself killed, we will all be doomed.~
@859  = ~Exactly. I would that you would allow me to cast every magical protection I know, in case there is an ambush waiting for us behind this door. But regardless, careful we must be.~
@860  = ~Do not have high hopes about the girl. Irenicus is a powerful mage, but she is not.~
@861  = ~We might try and overwhelm him, I suppose. But what of the Cowled Wizards? What of the other inmates? I doubt your magic stretches this far. Mine, I am sure, does not.~
@862  = ~No, we will not. Have you heard of spells that control the mind? Of magic that binds the body? Of arcane words stinging worse than any sword wound? But of course, you will ever be reaching for your weapon without any regard for your enemy.~
@863  = ~So I will have time to escape after you are discovered and killed? No. If we are meant to die, we shall die together.~
@864  = ~Shall we go and face our ultimate destruction? I shall stand by your side, whatever you do. But I beg of you, regardless of what you see there, be careful.~
@865  = ~I am truly sorry for what Irenicus has done to you. If there is something I can do...~ [O#XAN070]
@866  = ~Just stay by my side. We've yet to get out of here.~
@867  = ~What can you do? I am cursed, Xan. I will die.~
@868  = ~Aid me in Irenicus' defeat. This is all I ask of you.~
@869  = ~Nothing, but thank you for your words.~
@870  = ~I do not believe we can. Bodhi is too powerful for our miserable resources, let alone Irenicus. The fact that they never as much as touched our equipment speaks for itself.~
@871  = ~Cheer up, Xan! We'll get through this maze, and get them both.~
@872  = ~That's true. We will probably die in here.~
@873  = ~We are alive, we are equipped - what else can we wish for? Let's go!~
@874  = ~We will die indeed. I do not think that your curse is relevant: the inhabitants of this place will tear us apart before it runs its course.~
@875  = ~But regardless, we're all doomed.~
@876  = ~It is hopeless. Even if we join our efforts, nothing good will come of this. But if you wish to go on, by all means...~
@877  = ~I wish I could help with more than words, but Irenicus put us to sleep so quickly I was barely able to reach my spell components, let alone chant a spell. We are no match for him, I'm afraid.~
@878  = ~My throat is burning. How is it that anyone is able to breathe there?~ [O#XAN071]
@879  = ~Drow and duergar lived here for generations. They got used to it.~
@880  = ~I am breathing freely. What is wrong with you?~
@881  = ~I know what you mean. These walls are suffocating me.~
@882  = ~They have, but I... (cough) have not.~
@883  = ~The walls... the absence of the sky, the feeling of being underground... again.~
@884  = ~It is horrible. I will surely fall ill before long.~
@885  = ~Not only has Irenicus escaped, but he has chosen the most dangerous route. I won't be surprised if he survives, but I cannot say the same about our humble selves. We are doomed, and now the word has meaning.~
@886  = ~Yes, you are likely correct in this. It is possible that neither of us will see the sun.~
@887  = ~Never. We will survive, and we will win.~
@888  = ~You may be doomed, but I am DOOMED. Or do you know anyone who lived without a soul for longer than a month?~
@889  = ~Aw, Xan, relax! Look, it is the Underdark! The realm of countless legends, where evil lurks behind each shadow...~
@890  = ~I'd like to join this orgy of self-pitying, but we have to move on, and now.~
@891  = ~We are both doomed. You will turn into an empty husk of a <MANWOMAN> and die, and I will pass away because of simple influenza. More banal, but just as swift and sure.~
@892  = ~It is futile. But as you wish.~
@893  = ~<CHARNAME>, are you even listening to your own words? We are doomed! Doomed, I tell you!~
@894  = ~(sigh) It is futile.~
@895  = ~I do not like this place. It is almost alive.~ [O#XAN072]
@896  = ~What do you mean?~
@897  = ~Yes, it worries me, too.~
@898  = ~It is a temple of Lolth! What else did you expect?~
@899  = ~Is it? I do not feel anything out of the ordinary.~
@900  = ~It is vile to the point of nauseating. Can you imagine dozens of tentacles, ceaselessly trying to enter your head? The essence of purest malice, attacking your senses? The feeling of standing naked in the strong light? If you can, you will understand my emotions.~
@901  = ~I do not know how to describe it to you, if you do not feel the same.~
@902  = ~I did not expect such intensity. To my knowledge, only arcane magic is able to penetrate the mind so easily.~
@903  = ~You should. Pay no attention to the interior: drow never possessed a refined taste. Listen to your inner self, instead.~
@904  = ~I am an enchanter, as you well know. I can enter the mind of another sentient being and override its will. But now I understand what my victims must have felt. Another minute, and my mind will be overpowered.~
@905  = ~Understood that, did you? Well, better late than never, eh?~
@906  = ~Why do I feel nothing, then?~
@907  = ~I do not like this at all. We shall leave immediately after the talk with the Matron Mother.~
@908  = ~A pity, that. I wanted to walk around, to pretend to be a true worshipper of Lolth...~
@909  = ~I... I would like to think that I have been sparing in my practice, but still, it is disconcerting.~
@910  = ~Your soul is gone, so your sensitivity is hopelessly lost. It is a good thing in this case, but it will eventually lead to your demise.~
@911  = ~It will be the best solution for all involved.~
@912  = ~If you grant us enough time to get out of Ust Natha, do proceed. Otherwise I would advise you against it.~
@913  = ~Shall we move on? Or would you like us to be discovered here and now?~
@914  = ~I would bind this wound, if I were you. Now that your soul is gone, who knows what awaits you in the afterlife.~ [O#XAN073]
@915  = ~Don't worry, I have a healing potion somewhere. It will be all right in a minute, as good as new.~
@916  = ~Later. We've much to do, yet. This wound may not be the worst I receive today.~
@917  = ~No afterlife for the soulless. Only dust.~
@918  = ~Do not dramatize, Xan. I'll be fine.~
@919  = ~I do not imply that resting here is a good idea, but the other outcome is death. And for you, it is a highly undesirable one.~
@920  = ~Yes, I prefer to see you alive, if at all possible.~
@921  = ~I suspect as much. Why wouldn't you call a halt, instead?~
@922  = ~We have no time to rest.~
@923  = ~A good idea.~
@924  = ~All right, I'll look for a potion.~
@925  = ~Exactly what I implied. You do not want this.~
@926  = ~You will become dust. Perhaps it is indeed 'fine', as you have eloquently noted, but I tend to disbelieve it.~
@927  = ~When a Bhaalspawn dies, their essence feeds their father, and their soul departs for the Lower Planes. But you are a special case. Not truly alive, not truly dead - will you have to await Irenicus' demise suspended between darkness and light? Or will you simply... disappear?~
@928  = ~I will not know, because I will not die.~
@929  = ~My fate is tied to Irenicus', that's true. Perhaps we'll enter afterlife together.~
@930  = ~I do not revere a god, so I will not have an afterlife either way.~
@931  = ~Won't my deity shelter me?~
@932  = ~What if Irenicus dies? What happens to me then?~
@933  = ~Enough, Xan. I do not want to know.~
@934  = ~But what if Irenicus dies? I doubt it means continued life and prosperity for you.~
@935  = ~You may, since your ties with Bhaal are stronger than any worshipper's. But no deity, alive or dead, will shelter you while Irenicus lives. You live and die together.~
@936  = ~No deity will shelter you while Irenicus lives. You live and die together.~
@937  = ~This, indeed, is a mystery. But I fear that his demise will only lead to yours.~
@938  = ~(sigh) And you are right.~
@939  = ~It is a perversion. A man who has stolen your essence is closer to you than a lover. And what is more frightening, this knot can never be cut. If you kill him, you will die yourself.~
@940  = ~I... am... doomed.~
@941  = ~Is there another solution? There must be!~
@942  = ~I will follow him to the Lower Planes and kill him again and again!~
@943  = ~No. No more. If you go on, I'll die right here.~
@944  = ~You have a slim chance not to be, but it is slim indeed.~
@945  = ~If you kill Irenicus, you will at least be spared the agony of shriveling up spiritually. And, who knows, your soul may return. A feeble hope, but a hope nevertheless.~
@946  = ~Violence is not the solution there. (sigh) But who am I to rob you of this feeble hope?~
@947  = ~I will keep my mouth shut at all times, if it gives you hope. Though hope is a useless emotion at the moment.~
@948  = ~Hmm. I never thought I would survive this far.~ [O#XAN074]
@949  = ~Neither did I, but we are still in danger.~
@950  = ~Didn't I tell you I was invincible?~
@951  = ~Disappointed?~
@952  = ~We are - you are, that is. I... I suppose my task is done, now. I might even be honored for discovering a vampire plot and confronting Bodhi. But of course, I will never do this, not while your condition stays desperate.~
@953  = ~Remind me, who holds your spirit at the moment? Irenicus or <CHARNAME> the Bhaalspawn?~
@954  = ~No, but neither am I relieved. It is not like I am going home tomorrow, <CHARNAME>. I will be going off to die.~
@955  = ~When I sat in my home, I thought the mission was hopeless, and far too dangerous. But even I could not imagine it would be this risky. Learning about Bodhi's power, meeting you, traveling with a Bhaalspawn, confronting Irenicus, descending into the Underdark... Will I ever get some peace and quiet?~
@956  = ~Only beyond the grave.~
@957  = ~If you reach Evereska safely after Irenicus is destroyed - yes.~
@958  = ~Don't you like the life of adventure? Come, you should admit it is fun!~
@959  = ~I doubt there will be anything beyond the grave. With enemies like yours, my spirit is likely to be destroyed, as well.~
@960  = ~I want to believe it. We nearly killed him once, so there is hope. There has to be.~
@961  = ~We pay for this 'fun' with our lives. I am not ready for such a sacrifice.~
@962  = ~(sigh) Enough of this. Rest well, <CHARNAME>.~
@963  = ~Now my mission is truly complete. You've done a great service to Elvendom, my friend.~ [O#XAN075]
@964  = ~With your help.~
@965  = ~Do I get a reward?~
@966  = ~Why would elves of Evereska worry about a vampire in the human lands?~
@967  = ~To the Nine Hells with your Elvendom! I needed to survive.~
@968  = ~I am not proficient in fighting against vampires, alas. Their charms are deadlier than mine. But I am glad to have proven myself useful.~
@969  = ~You can help yourself to my meager equipment. I have no hidden coffers, however. The only payment I can offer is my life, for I intend to fight for Suldanessellar at your side.~
@970  = ~The Council was vexed about Bodhi's coven. They never knew she was an elf, but got news that she was old, old enough to enter the stage where a single vampire can terrorize the whole city.~
@971  = ~Athkatla is far from Evereska, but trade routs, diplomatic agreements and local conflicts play their role. We could not stay indifferent, and so I was chosen and sent to die. I live, though - but not for long.~
@972  = ~Still, you have done Evereska a great service.~
@973  = ~I do not know how much it means to you, but to me the knowledge that my kin is dying somewhere, hidden from the world by some malicious intent, is excruciating. I would ask you to face Irenicus as soon as possible. We will perish, but our deaths will prevent many more.~
@974  = ~We shall do our best.~
@975  = ~I still have some tasks to perform. Suldanessellar will have to wait a few days.~
@976  = ~Preparation is essential. We need supplies for our battle with Irenicus.~
@977  = ~Who cares about some elves? It is my life, mine!~
@978  = ~If only honorable intentions granted us victory... But we shall die, <CHARNAME>, quickly and quietly. Well, at least we shall be able to say we tried.~
@979  = ~I will wait. But if you intend to save lives by lingering here, prepare for a disappointment.~
@980  = ~And I wish you well in preserving it. But for your own sake, reconsider. If you do not reach Irenicus in time, you are doomed, and so are my people.~
@981  = ~But... if we do not die... if we survive, and Irenicus is banished... your soul is restored, and my obligation to you comes to an end...~
@982  = ~Dare I hope for this? Dare I hope that I will live to see Evereska again? Dare I hope for a few months of peace after I report that my mission is complete?~
@983  = ~Yes. We shall destroy Irenicus, save Suldanessellar, and you will depart with my blessings.~
@984  = ~The chances are slim. You should prepare for the worst.~
@985  = ~Irenicus will die, but I have other enemies. Won't you stay by my side?~
@986  = ~What? I am not letting you go!~
@987  = ~These are only dreams, <CHARNAME>. But thank you for indulging them.~
@988  = ~I will die indeed. But hope is bittersweet, and as the days go, I find myself clinging to it... but I ramble. Come, let us go.~
@989  = ~Do not tempt the Fates. Should I stay with you, I will be killed at best, and assist the new <LADYLORD> of Murder at worst. In the second case, I shall also die, since my moonblade will not tolerate this. You may not be wholeheartedly evil, but your legacy is. I want no part of it.~
@990  = ~Very well. Do as you wish.~
@991  = ~You will die in my service, anyway.~
@992  = ~Reconsider, Xan. You will regret it.~
@993  = ~No, you will regret it if you press the issue. I owe much to you, but my duty is to my people alone.~
@994  = ~What horror... what shame...~ [O#XAN076]
@995  = ~An entire city doomed, my people dying in droves, and all of this is the work of a single madman!~
@996  = ~Our people, Xan. I am an elf, too.~
@997  = ~It is terrible, I agree. We shall do our best to save them.~
@998  = ~Irenicus is my sole goal. Your people are on their own.~
@999  = ~Your people created Irenicus. It is only fair that they should pay.~
@1000 = ~We must destroy the madman swiftly, lest more lives be lost.~
@1001 = ~Of course, mellonamin. We are standing together in this, as well as in anything else.~
@1002 = ~Still, I am tempted to go off alone, since I know that you will be devoting your strength to pursuing Irenicus. I do not know, <CHARNAME>. I do not know which road to follow.~
@1003 = ~Xan, listen to me. We shall save every elf and destroy every monster we meet, and Suldanessellar will be safe again.~
@1004 = ~Follow me. That is the road you need to take.~
@1005 = ~If you are so unsure, perhaps you'd better go alone.~
@1006 = ~I do not know what to advise you. You have to make the choice yourself.~
@1007 = ~You did not mean that, did you? Irenicus is your foremost goal, but will you pass by helpless people, begging for your help?~
@1008 = ~Yes, I will. I do not care about them.~
@1009 = ~It was their fault all along! Elhan denied me the information, then I found out that Bodhi was an elf, and now it seems like Irenicus is an elf, as well!~
@1010 = ~In other circumstances, I would not, but I need my soul now, more than anything.~
@1011 = ~No, I did not mean that. I will help the elves of Suldanessellar, if I can.~
@1012 = ~<CHARNAME>, I do not know the truth, and I doubt that we shall ever find it out. But I see my kin dying, and by Seldarine, I will not stand idle and watch! Are you with me or not?~
@1013 = ~No, I will not help you.~
@1014 = ~I am with you. Let us go and save whomever we can.~
@1015 = ~I need to know the truth, first.~
@1016 = ~Irenicus, however, is a major threat. I will follow you, but do not expect me to do so after he has fallen. Your path is all too clear.~
@1017 = ~But even together, do we have the strength? It will not end well, I know. Whatever we do, Suldanessellar will be utterly destroyed. It is pointless.~
@1018 = ~Do you think you will be more successful if you go on your own?~
@1019 = ~Pointless or not, I will do whatever needs to be done.~
@1020 = ~I have no choice. My soul awaits.~
@1021 = ~Xan, stop right now! We need to go on and help people, not to talk!~
@1022 = ~I...~
@1023 = ~No, I cannot. Irenicus is a major threat. If we do not stop him, all will die. Lead on.~
@1024 = ~No. No, of course not. The idea of leaving you now is preposterous. Still, I can hear the screams of the wounded and the dying, and... (sigh) Let us just go.~
@1025 = ~I shall follow, then. Lead on, but remember: you have promised to help, and I will hold you to it.~
@1026 = ~And Irenicus, as well. Lead on, but remember: you have promised to help, and I will hold you to it.~
@1027 = ~Indeed. I am sorry, <CHARNAME>; these events affect me too deeply to think clearly. Lead on.~
@1028 = ~What does he need there? His sister mentioned that he was one of us, and Elhan confirmed her words. What could have happened to make him an exile? It frightens me.~
@1029 = ~Some grave atrocity, perhaps?~
@1030 = ~He could have become an exile of his own volition.~
@1031 = ~Is being exiled from the elven community that bad?~
@1032 = ~I have no idea. Do you?~
@1033 = ~Indeed. I can surmise that he had greatly offended the Elven spirit, or murdered many of his brethren. Either way, the harm he has caused you and Imoen shows that he feels no remorse for his past crimes.~
@1034 = ~It is impossible. Will you voluntary stop to breathe? To see? To walk?~
@1035 = ~Bad? Are you even serious?~
@1036 = ~No. I can surmise that he had greatly offended the Elven spirit, or murdered many of his brethren. Either way, the harm he has caused you and Imoen shows that he feels no remorse for his past crimes.~
@1037 = ~We must hurry. Who knows what rituals he is performing at the moment.~
@1038 = ~To become severed from the Spirit is to experience the loneliness you cannot imagine. Once exiled, the elf will lose the gift of longevity, start to wither, lose their memories, and in the end will never reach the Blessed Realm of Arvandor. A fate worse than death, and I am not exaggerating.~
@1039 = ~What is the point? Is truth more important to you than lives? (sigh) Oh, very well.~
@1040 = ~You are acquiring much power. What will you use it for?~ [O#XAN077]
@1041 = ~To defend myself. A Bhaalspawn does not exactly experience a shortage of enemies.~
@1042 = ~You call this power? Ha! Talk to me when I wear my sire's regalia!~
@1043 = ~How much good I will be able to bring to this world...~
@1044 = ~Nothing overly ostentatious. A small kingdom, a cosy palace, a moderate army of minions - I am modest in my requests.~
@1045 = ~No, and neither does <HESHE> have friends in abundance. I am sorry, <CHARNAME>. Power or not, life will always be hard for you, it seems.~
@1046 = ~Oh, I'll manage. Besides, I might be powerful enough to become a god. You never know.~
@1047 = ~I do not expect any better. I help people, and that's enough for me.~
@1048 = ~Trust me, I am content with whatever number of friends I have.~
@1049 = ~True. I am doomed to be alone and friendless.~
@1050 = ~Should I take it as a compliment? (sigh) Thank you, in any case.~
@1051 = ~This is not the heaviest price for power. The true cost is your life and soul, and I am afraid that the payment is long overdue.~
@1052 = ~You want to claim godhood, then? It is fortunate I shall not be able to witness this: your ascension ritual will probably require barbaric measures. Sacrificing your companions, for example.~
@1053 = ~Xan, please! That's just your inflamed imagination!~
@1054 = ~Perhaps, perhaps. Are you ready to be sacrificed in the name of my glory, by the way?~
@1055 = ~No. I want power, but I will never sink to such lows.~
@1056 = ~You are a sane and reasonable <MANWOMAN> now, but what happens once the power is within your grasp? You'll kill without hesitation.~
@1057 = ~You will die before you are able to do anything significant. Dark fanatics rule this world, not heroic champions. But even if you overthrow the tyrants and destroy the monsters, you will likely be killed by the very people you will be helping. This is the fate of the large-hearted on this Plane.~
@1058 = ~That doesn't stop me. I will continue, no matter the cost.~
@1059 = ~I am not going to stay mortal. My divine essence will help me.~
@1060 = ~Then I will simply retire and live my life in luxury, giving out help moderately.~
@1061 = ~If I am alive at the time, I will come to your funeral.~
@1062 = ~Will you choose degradation? Abandon your art, stop acquiring new knowledge and start descending into the grave?~
@1063 = ~Not at all. Knowledge is not necessarily gained in battle.~
@1064 = ~Have you ever heard the words "well-deserved rest"?~
@1065 = ~Luxury is important, but most of all, I want to live a normal life.~
@1066 = ~Yes, if it allows me to start a family and to be loved.~
@1067 = ~I wish you well. You certainly deserve rest, and you are decent enough to be respected and loved. Alas, Irenicus would rather kill you out of spite than allow you to sit in a palace garden, reading an ancient tome to your child. Power does not delay death: it rushes it.~
@1068 = ~I have always known that life was nonsensical, and all other assumptions were groundless, but now I see it in earnest.~ [O#XAN078]
@1069 = ~Why love, when you are not allowed to be loved? Why hope, when all hope is crushed by reality? Why?~
@1070 = ~You know, I really missed you.~
@1071 = ~Indeed, why love and trust when one you love abandons you to torture and death!~
@1072 = ~Because love is not futile, no matter the cost?~
@1073 = ~Why indeed?~
@1074 = ~But it's all right now. We are together again!~
@1075 = ~Why speak, when all you want to say can be said without words?~
@1076 = ~I know. Would that you only missed me, safe and unharmed...~
@1077 = ~Yes, these days were hard for both of us.~
@1078 = ~Well, I had Irenicus for company, if you mean this.~
@1079 = ~(grin) And I am ready to prove it.~
@1080 = ~<CHARNAME>, I will beg for your forgiveness endlessly, if it will help. But will it? What is done is done. Worse, had I not departed for Evereska, I would probably have taken poor Dynaheir's place.~
@1081 = ~Still, it is a cruel thing to say. You were there, safe, while I suffered.~
@1082 = ~I wish you would! This way, I would not feel betrayed!~
@1083 = ~True. Let us put it behind us, then.~
@1084 = ~Is it? When I look at you, I agree with your every word, but when I turn away, I understand it is indeed futile.~
@1085 = ~Look at me. Do you think we truly have a future?~
@1086 = ~Yes, if we try hard enough.~
@1087 = ~No, I suppose not.~
@1088 = ~Does it matter? What matters is that we have this night, together...~
@1089 = ~Yes, you know the answer, and it is always a 'no'. No hope, no point, no future.~
@1090 = ~Indeed, the world is coming to an end.~
@1091 = ~What do we do, then? Part before the face of our destiny?~
@1092 = ~I've been thinking: maybe it is worth it to spit on the Fates and just continue living?~
@1093 = ~Ever optimistic, I see. When will you see that you are wrong? On your deathbed?~
@1094 = ~I have all reasons to look forward to the future. I defeated Sarevok, I got out of Irenicus' clutches, and I found you again.~
@1095 = ~If you see nothing good in this world, you will break down very quickly.~
@1096 = ~(grin) No. But I like the word 'bed'.~
@1097 = ~<CHARNAME>...~
@1098 = ~Shh... say nothing.~
@1099 = ~Xan...~
@1100 = ~Gods, you are trembling! What's the matter?~
@1101 = ~Nothing. I am afraid you will disappear.~
@1102 = ~How I missed you...~
@1103 = ~I was wrong when I said I'd never forget Mulahey and my imprisonment. There are far worse horrors. To feel that you suffer, somewhere, everywhere, always, the sensation slowly forcing out other thoughts, filling my world...~
@1104 = ~I felt your pain through our bond, and it nearly made me pass out. It is frightening enough to face a powerful enemy, but even more so to walk on the road, feeling stabs of pain coming out of nowhere. I cannot even imagine what it was like for you, if it nearly killed me.~
@1105 = ~But I am pathetic. You suffered, you were tortured, and I keep rambling about my own pain. I am sorry, <CHARNAME>.~
@1106 = ~I understand... and you have my forgiveness.~
@1107 = ~Well, you could stop rambling and turn to more... pleasant matters.~
@1108 = ~You are always thinking about yourself! Just leave me be!~
@1109 = ~I am too willing to try, but it will be difficult.~
@1110 = ~Safe? <CHARNAME>, you do not know what you are talking about.~
@1111 = ~Beautiful... you are angry, tired and distraught. Rest, and you may yell all you want in the morning. I see that it is inevitable.~
@1112 = ~Wait... I am sorry. Will you stay with me tonight?~
@1113 = ~Traitor!~
@1114 = ~(remain silent)~
@1115 = ~Judging by the past days, I am willing to believe it is.~
@1116 = ~How? I am not able to part with you, not more than abhor myself, though I am doing it endlessly, these days. We share a lifetime bond, and these are not words.~
@1117 = ~We will not be able to do this. The monster is out on the loose, and eventually, you will confront him again. I know I will not survive it: for me, the first time was enough.~
@1118 = ~But are you aware of the cost? Your friends' deaths, your childhood companion's capture, and pain upon pain - and not for you alone.~
@1119 = ~(sigh) I am breaking down already, it seems.~
@1120 = ~Sometimes I think you understand me better than I do myself. But I cannot continue, not with you in front of me... so beautiful...~
@1121 = ~Neither can I.~
@1122 = ~Look who is beautiful.~
@1123 = ~No, Xan. I am sorry, but I want to be alone tonight.~
@1124 = ~(sigh) Now it is my turn to understand, it seems. But I do. Rest well.~
@1125 = ~You are awake, but you look pale, as if you have not rested. What is it? Is it another nightmare?~ [O#XAN079]
@1126 = ~I am looking pink and fresh, thank you very much! Pfft... Men!~
@1127 = ~No, I am fine. That's probably a trick of the light.~
@1128 = ~Yes, a nightmare again.~
@1129 = ~Not a nightmare. I've been thinking of dark things.~
@1130 = ~I don't think we had enough time to sleep, did we?~
@1131 = ~Why in blazes do you need to know? Go back to your precious Evereska, and leave me alone!~
@1132 = ~Ah, and insufferably cheerful, as well. But I will chase your smile away in a moment, I'm afraid.~
@1133 = ~Yes, you are fine - you are perfect. I am loath to ask and ruin your serene expression, but I have to.~
@1134 = ~This... Irenicus. Will you talk to me? What did he do to you?~
@1135 = ~I do not remember most of it. I came to around the time when Imoen rescued me from my cage.~
@1136 = ~He was practicing spells on me. Sometimes conjuring vines, so I could barely breathe, let alone dodge the spell, sometimes just bathing me in flames.~
@1137 = ~No. I will not speak about it.~
@1138 = ~Ah. We haven't finished yesterday's conversation, I see. Do go on.~
@1139 = ~Don't you know what I will say? You hurt me, left me alone, abandoned me!~
@1140 = ~Um... er...~
@1141 = ~No, I am sorry.~
@1142 = ~<CHARNAME>, I am not blaming you. It was my fault all along. But if you do not lay the matter at rest, it will break the bond between us.~
@1143 = ~Don't be. It was my fault all along.~
@1144 = ~Yes, and I am remorseful for that. Had I known... Had I known, we would have been dead, most likely.~
@1145 = ~How could she do it? Imoen was captured with you, was she not?~
@1146 = ~Yes, she was. Now that you mention it, it is indeed strange.~
@1147 = ~She saw more than me, too. When we entered the bedroom that belonged to Irenicus' wife, she said she had been there already. Why was he more interested in her than in me?~
@1148 = ~Irenicus released her for an experiment, I guess. She was saying strange things, like "death is pretty", and her head hurt. She also wore a strange belt neither of us could remove.~
@1149 = ~She must have opened her cell somehow.~
@1150 = ~I think that he wanted her to release me.~
@1151 = ~Mindless vermin... By Seldarine, it is a miracle that you are alive! But of course, he wouldn't want to let you die - a Bhaalspawn, a treasured prize, no doubt. How did you get out?~
@1152 = ~There was a diversion, Irenicus was called away, and Imoen sneaked into the room and opened my cage.~
@1153 = ~It was terrible. His whole dungeon reeked of unnatural deaths, with the results of his experiments everywhere, from maimed creatures in tanks to captured dryads.~
@1154 = ~Stepping over bodies, how else?~
@1155 = ~You do not need to. But I will not shrink, if you want me to listen.~
@1156 = ~It is strange indeed. Why would he allow her to walk free, when she could - and did - help you escape? It defies logic. I do not understand this, and it frightens me more than if I did. And he is still alive...~
@1157 = ~Was your friend able to open the door with a pin or some such? How? Did Irenicus lack the knowledge of magical wards?~
@1158 = ~Maybe he wanted her to release me!~
@1159 = ~Yes, it is strange.~
@1160 = ~It's not important, anyway.~
@1161 = ~Release you? Give up a prized possession he had been hoping for so long to get close to? No, I do not believe he would. And he is still alive...~
@1162 = ~(sigh) I wish to comfort you, but the only consolation I have is that you will never see the place again, for it is buried under layers of rock.~
@1163 = ~This is something you're accustomed to doing, I know, but I am sorry to hear that you had to do it yet again.~
@1164 = ~We should run away, and do so now. But it is too late, isn't it? The wheels of your destiny are in motion again, and until they make the full circle, we shall be deprived of any choice. <CHARNAME>... I have a feeling that one of us will not survive this chase.~
@1165 = ~But I do not want it to happen!~
@1166 = ~Maybe. But what can we do to prevent it?~
@1167 = ~We will. I am used to killing, and we are quite powerful, so we stand a chance.~
@1168 = ~If we sit here and talk of death, we'll never get anything done. Come, let's face the day.~
@1169 = ~No, not as such. What is important is that this Irenicus is still alive.~
@1170 = ~I do not think your wishes hold any power here. But for once, I would like to be proven wrong.~
@1171 = ~Yes... it is useless to speculate. Let us go, then.~
@1172 = ~What is a chance against dead certainty? It is pointless to hope for a miracle.~
@1173 = ~What is the point? (sigh) Ah, very well.~
@1174 = ~Have you noticed how strongly your path is affected by treachery?~ [O#XAN080]
@1175 = ~I am a Bhaalspawn; I should get used to it.~
@1176 = ~It's hard not to. When did it start? With Sarevok's doppelgangers? With Tamoko?~
@1177 = ~Yes, Yoshimo was a fine example.~
@1178 = ~No, I haven't. Why?~
@1179 = ~It all started when you learned of your true heritage, I suppose.~
@1180 = ~Yoshimo acted on Irenicus' orders, and Irenicus was interested in your divine essence. So, it all started with your heritage.~
@1181 = ~You are a Bhaalspawn, but you are not truly a demigod. You are a woman - sometimes so sure of yourself, sometimes lost and frightened - and being just a woman, you do not deserve the betrayals your heritage placed upon you.~
@1182 = ~Because, my ignorant Bhaalspawn, betrayal follows you all the way, from the suspicious ambush near Candlekeep a year ago to numerous spies, following us even now. All of it being the courtesy of your father, of course.~
@1183 = ~When we learned of Bhaal being your sire, I was shocked, to say the least. To know that you may turn into Bhaal's incarnation any moment was disconcerting - and it still is. But you are suffering doubly: shunned by ordinary people, denied friendship, the sense of communion... love. How is it that you are able to survive it all?~
@1184 = ~On the contrary, my heritage draws people to me like flies to honey. I feel my pull on the others, and it is incredible.~
@1185 = ~Some fear me, but I will always be able to find true allies. I am a demigod!~
@1186 = ~It is my heart's desire to be normal, but I'm afraid it is not meant to happen.~
@1187 = ~There are people who love me, despite my heritage. You, for example.~
@1188 = ~I am not. I keep closing my eyes and wishing fervently for death to come.~
@1189 = ~This is certainly a novel thought. Do you imply that back in Nashkel, I was drawn to you by your heritage, and it alone?~
@1190 = ~I don't know. Were you?~
@1191 = ~You should ask yourself.~
@1192 = ~I think so.~
@1193 = ~No, probably not. I thought myself normal back then.~
@1194 = ~When I recall those days, I remember that you were young, hunted, elven, and had no home. I felt obliged to help. When I was finally able to recognize my feelings, it was already too late, and you would not let me go, as you must remember. Now, however, we are tasting the consequences.~
@1195 = ~Then I am truly doomed, as it extends its pull with every passing day. But enough of this.~
@1196 = ~So did I, but time proved us wrong.~
@1197 = ~You will find some power-hungry thugs, I doubt it not. But how many people will like and respect you for who you are, and not for what you are?~
@1198 = ~They will. I think it is part of my heritage - people are attracted to me, not repelled by me.~
@1199 = ~There are quite a few who do, you among them.~
@1200 = ~None. You are right, it is far better to be a normal woman.~
@1201 = ~I do not know whether it is possible... but I hope that some day, the shadow of your heritage will be lifted.~
@1202 = ~I love you, but I cannot substitute the world for you.~
@1203 = ~<CHARNAME>, no! My heart nearly stopped now, and I will not have you saying this again. We are not continuing this conversation, not going anywhere, and not doing anything, until you feel better. Come here... I am not letting you go, not until you decide that this life is worth living.~
@1204 = ~...~
@1205 = ~Estel'amin... cormamin... amael'amin... you will not die, even if you have a foolish notion to do so. I will not leave you, whatever happens. Till death do us part, and I will make sure it will be mine.~
@1206 = ~For the time being, no elven community will accept you, and among humans, betrayals will continue. Will it change? I see no hope that it will. I tried to live for the moment, forgetting about your heritage, our uncertain - or, rather, very certain - future, but every time I see the pain in your eyes, it makes my heart stop. I wish to spare you from this, but all I seem to do is to make matters worse; I can shield you neither from betrayal nor from death. What do I do?~
@1207 = ~Just stay yourself. For me, it is enough.~
@1208 = ~Promise to never leave me again. Whatever happens.~
@1209 = ~If you'd be a bit more cheerful, I'd appreciate it. All this doom and gloom is too much for me sometimes.~
@1210 = ~As ever, you are reassuring me in the end, and not the other way around. But from now on I will do my best to change it.~
@1211 = ~<CHARNAME>, corm en' cormamin, I will not leave you, whatever happens. Till death do us part, and I will make sure it will be mine.~
@1212 = ~(sigh) You'll want me picking flowers next, I assume. I will try, but you may not like the result.~
@1213 = ~There is another thing, however, a vow I have intended to give you since the day I learned of your capture. It is formal... but sincere.~
@1214 = ~After the recent happenings, local sights should be the last thing on my mind, but I keep reflecting on the forests of the Sword Coast. Do you?~ [O#XAN081]
@1215 = ~After Irenicus? Please!~
@1216 = ~I do not remember much of it. Irenicus tampered with my memory, you see.~
@1217 = ~I miss these places, too. They were beautiful.~
@1218 = ~I liked them well enough, but Amn appeals to me more.~
@1219 = ~He tried to suppress your soul, but you may find remedy in beauty.~
@1220 = ~Did... did he? Does it mean you do not have any memory of the past year at all? The Nashkel mines is not the best place to remember, but we met there. Is there nothing you recall?~
@1221 = ~I recall almost everything, but surroundings are a blur.~
@1222 = ~I remember our love, but only barely.~
@1223 = ~(sigh) This is a relief. I will remind you of this missing detail, then.~
@1224 = ~I see... but I do not believe it. Does it mean that you remember nothing? How I tried to get you to talk about Gorion, kept warning you about the dangers of adventuring life, woke you up after your nightmares, told you the story of the moonblade, almost ran away from you - nothing?~
@1225 = ~Nothing. I'm sorry.~
@1226 = ~Oh dear. Actually, I am *glad* that I do not remember it.~
@1227 = ~What was it about your moonblade?~
@1228 = ~Now that you say it, I recall something, but surroundings are a blur.~
@1229 = ~So, you lost it all. I thought it would hurt, but I feel strangely numb. To hear "I do not remember your love" was too much for me.~
@1230 = ~But if your memories are gone, I will share mine with you.~
@1231 = ~It is a sad story, but I will relive it again, word for word. Do you wish me to?~
@1232 = ~I do.~
@1233 = ~I think not. Tell me of more pleasant things, instead.~
@1234 = ~No, I do not feel well. Let us end this discussion altogether.~
@1235 = ~The sword I wield has a cruel tale to tell. It has originally been forged to choose a royal family, but now it is only a symbol, albeit an important one. The blade is thousands of years old, and it has passed through many hands, eventually ending up in mine. The previous owners are not simply dead, but their spirits are trapped within the moonblade, a terrible price to pay for using its abilities. Only when the blade's magic is no more are they allowed to travel to Arvandor. A similar fate awaits me in the end.~
@1236 = ~As for how I acquired it... I was very young then, perhaps even younger than you are now. The death of my sire was a terrible shock on its own, and the subsequent death of my sibling, who found his doom in Icewind Dale, added to it. After these events I lost the will to live. Nothing was important, so when I realized that someone from my House had to step forward and claim the blade, I volunteered without thinking. Nevertheless, it was a terrifying experience, standing in a ray of blue fire and waiting for an uncertain death. You see, drawing the blade can easily result in the claimant's death, if the sword finds him unworthy. I survived, but the reflection of that day haunts me, still.~
@1237 = ~I'm so sorry...~
@1238 = ~Oh. I didn't know that.~
@1239 = ~Fascinating.~
@1240 = ~It makes no difference, since you shall die the final death, and we shall never be reunited in Arvandor. But enough of this; let us talk of more pleasant things. The forests of the Sword Coast, for example.~
@1241 = ~Of course. Call for rest whenever you need.~
@1242 = ~But can Amn truly compare to the Sword Coast? Judge for yourself.~
@1243 = ~There were the Cloakwood waterfalls, sparkling like an elven veil, rainbow sunrises at the Cloudpeaks, wondrous trees, almost as old as the land itself, and quiet, secluded places away in the sunlight and starlight. There was beauty to be found. Here there is none.~
@1244 = ~Too true. I wish I was back there again.~
@1245 = ~You forgot to mention that there was me, too.~
@1246 = ~You may have loved these places, because back then I was not a Bhaalspawn.~
@1247 = ~What about spiders, infecting the Cloakwood forest? Or wolves in the Cloudpeaks?~
@1248 = ~I still prefer Athkatla and her surroundings.~
@1249 = ~Greycloak Hills? May we travel there some day?~
@1250 = ~Compared to Irenicus, these dangers are no dangers at all. The beauty remains.~
@1251 = ~Athkatla provides you with a wider range of opportunities to kill yourself, I dare say, so Bhaal in you revels in it. But what if there were no liches to hunt, no dragons to kill, and no dark organizations to join? What then?~
@1252 = ~I would have liked the Sword Coast better, I guess.~
@1253 = ~I am still enamoured of Athkatla and Amn.~
@1254 = ~No idea.~
@1255 = ~So would I. The memory is doubly breathtaking because you were there with me.~
@1256 = ~I am not. But I am enamored of you, and that is enough for me.~
@1257 = ~Never mind: my question made no sense. Whatever you prefer is irrelevant, since your destiny leaves you no choice. And for me it is doubly so, as I'll follow you wherever you go.~
@1258 = ~<CHARNAME>, <CHARNAME>, you know that we do not. Were we able to, I would hide you there, and no Irenicus could claim you as his test subject. Do not spill salt on my open wounds.~
@1259 = ~But of course. All this beauty would mean nothing without you by my side, however trite it sounds. You are an essential part of me. Of us, for there is no me without you.~
@1260 = ~So, no matter where, Amn or the Realm of Baldur's Gate, the main thing's me, eh?~
@1261 = ~Still, I would prefer to be among the glades and waterfalls, not this drab hole.~
@1262 = ~Flatterer.~
@1263 = ~Be more original next time, will you?~
@1264 = ~Alas, our desires play no role in the big picture of things.~
@1265 = ~I love you; I cannot help but be one.~
@1266 = ~This is beyond my ability, I'm afraid. The best I can do is to look at you in silence and... oh, but enough of this.~
@1267 = ~Without a doubt.~
@1268 = ~I regret having started reminiscing the other day. I cannot stop thinking of Evereska.~ [O#XAN082]
@1269 = ~Are you homesick?~
@1270 = ~So do I. Candlekeep is always on my mind.~
@1271 = ~Why? Is there anything for you there?~
@1272 = ~You can never come back. Get used to it.~
@1273 = ~I have neither friends nor family there, but I miss it just the same. It is safe, it is secure, and it is home. Or, rather, it was: now that I travel with you, I will never see it again.~
@1274 = ~Neither friends nor family? What happened to them?~
@1275 = ~I feel for you and your loss. Is there nothing I can do?~
@1276 = ~Are you implying that it is all my fault?~
@1277 = ~I never had time to make any friends, since I was fully absorbed in my magic. As for my family, it happened gradually: the death of my father, the slow passing of my mother, the foolish Retreat and, finally, my own departure. If you find yourself in Evereska, you will see no members of our House there.~
@1278 = ~How did your parents die?~
@1279 = ~The Retreat?~
@1280 = ~What is your last name, by the way? Is it just 'Xan'?~
@1281 = ~Oh, my father died the heroic death of a warrior. Curiously, as he had the gift of foresight, he knew it would happen, and had no choice but to die fighting. I always wondered how it must be, to know that you were going to die and to be unable to prevent it. Now... now I do.~
@1282 = ~And what of your mother?~
@1283 = ~What have we all done to deserve this?~
@1284 = ~Enough, Xan. No more.~
@1285 = ~She was bonded to my father, just like I am bonded to you. He died, and she died of grief shortly afterwards, becoming paler, thinner and more absorbed in herself with every passing day. It was a shock to return from another mission and to see a walking corpse instead of a living woman. They are not together: my father's spirit will only be released after the blade becomes dormant. I can only hope she is at peace in Arvandor.~
@1286 = ~My poor Xan...~
@1287 = ~We were born in the unhappy times. Your birth was foreseen and cursed by many, mine was expected only by two people, but the end result is the same.~
@1288 = ~Of course, <CHARNAME>. I am sorry.~
@1289 = ~It is strange that you do not know. The Elven Retreat is a mass departure to the isle of Evermeet, which is believed to be protected by Hanali Celanil. Fools, one and all. They have no hope to survive, and their naive belief in the island's invulnerability would make me laugh, were it not so sad. I tried to make my siblings reconsider, but it was futile. Soon, the drow will launch their attack, and this time, they will be successful.~
@1290 = ~It is irrelevant, as the name will soon be extinct.~
@1291 = ~Nothing, I fear, except for altering your heritage somehow.~
@1292 = ~No, of course not. I cannot, and will not, enter Evereska again without you. It is my choice, and therefore, my fault.~
@1293 = ~And Gorion, I take it? I am sorry, <CHARNAME>. Perhaps some day...~
@1294 = ~Some day - what? Do you want me to return to a nest of doppelgangers?~
@1295 = ~I doubt it. I do not think I am wanted there.~
@1296 = ~I may visit Gorion's tomb in the future.~
@1297 = ~Not Gorion. I never liked the old spider.~
@1298 = ~You spent decades there, so whatever became of the place and its denizens, you have a right to call it home. But I understand your reluctance. After what we saw in the Candlekeep catacombs, I am not eager to visit the place, either.~
@1299 = ~This is a human tradition rather than elven. Fallen Teu'Tel'Quessir are buried deep underground in quiet glens, and only the family members know the exact place. But your foster father would have wanted you to visit his grave, I suppose.~
@1300 = ~He manipulated you, concealing your true heritage, so I understand your feelings. But if not for him, we would have never become close. Had I known that you were a Bhaalspawn, I would have stayed away for my own sake. (sigh) I do not know whether I should bless his memory or curse it.~
@1301 = ~I am fully aware of it, my kind reminder. (sigh) But you are right, it is pointless. Let us continue, <CHARNAME>. I am sorry for this interruption.~
@1302 = ~It is peculiar: a year ago, I used to pity you, a fugitive, hunted by all, but now I do not have a home, either. I paid my last visit to the temple, packed some belongings and left the city forever. I am used to wandering, being a Greycloak, but who am I now? Time will tell, but it is painful for the time being.~
@1303 = ~I hoped you'd say that my company cures it all.~
@1304 = ~It will get better. We'll continue adventuring, become renown heroes...~
@1305 = ~It will get better. We'll settle down, start a family...~
@1306 = ~I know of a remedy. Shall I apply it tonight?~
@1307 = ~It does. If it did not, I would not be telling you this. I wish to know your thoughts, and I wish to tell you of mine.~
@1308 = ~And die. Adventuring means risk, risk means danger, and danger means death, as I told you time and again. Why would you want it?~
@1309 = ~Because I like taking risks.~
@1310 = ~I want fame and fortune.~
@1311 = ~Do I have a choice?~
@1312 = ~No, and neither do I. But... perhaps... one day...~
@1313 = ~Never mind.~
@1314 = ~You are not afraid to have children with me? Your mother likely died in childbirth; what if the same happens to you? Divine blood is not to be trifled with.~
@1315 = ~Oh, I did not mean children. Just settling down somewhere with you.~
@1316 = ~I would risk it. I want your child.~
@1317 = ~No, I guess not.~
@1318 = ~It is the best possibility there is, I suppose. I, too, would rather savour quiet time with you than perish in battle for the Greater Good... or whatever humans call it these days.~
@1319 = ~No, beautiful, you will risk yourself over my dead body. Though I believe you could...~
@1320 = ~Absolutely, but... (sigh) Never mind.~
@1321 = ~I know I should have asked this before, but it slipped my mind completely. When were you born?~ [O#XAN083]
@1322 = ~You should know better than to ask a woman about her age.~
@1323 = ~Twenty one years ago. I am not sure where, however.~
@1324 = ~From what I know, I must be a hundred years old or so, but I do not recall all of it.~
@1325 = ~I do not remember my exact age.~
@1326 = ~Were you an ordinary woman, I would not, but you are much more than this. You are my world. Will you tell me?~
@1327 = ~Very well. I was born twenty one years ago.~
@1328 = ~I must be around a hundred years old.~
@1329 = ~I do not remember.~
@1330 = ~No, and do not press me again.~
@1331 = ~But it is not possible. You are an elf. Were you truly in your twenties, you would be a child. Why would you think so?~
@1332 = ~I must have read it somewhere in Gorion's papers. Never mind.~
@1333 = ~I am only partly elven. Another part of me is immortal, and it could influence my aging.~
@1334 = ~Do you mean that elves age much slower than humans?~
@1335 = ~I do not know; it's all messed up inside my head! I do not remember my past, do not know where I was born, don't even know how old I am!~
@1336 = ~We do. My kin, moon elves, come of age around one hundred. It is not set in stone, but most feel that this is how it should be. But I was talking about your age.~
@1337 = ~You look around that age, I agree. But how could it be, when your divine sire walked the lands before the Time of Troubles, ten years ago?~
@1338 = ~Ah. I see. So Bhaal foresaw his own death over a century ago? His guile was indeed legendary.~
@1339 = ~An interesting guess.~
@1340 = ~Yes, Bhaal was great, but who cares about me? It's all messed up inside my head! I do not remember my past, do not know where I was born, don't even know how old I am!~
@1341 = ~Was Irenicus tampering with your mind, or is it another curse of your mixed lineage, I wonder? But we'll never know, of course.~
@1342 = ~I suppose not.~
@1343 = ~I have just come of age, so I might be a hundred or so.~
@1344 = ~No, we won't! It's all messed up inside my head! I do not remember my past, do not know where I was born, don't even know how old I am!~
@1345 = ~It shall be as you say. Though I wonder why.~
@1346 = ~<CHARNAME>... I know how hard it is. I have started this talk to lighten you up a little... but I see I have achieved the opposite result. (sigh) But perhaps I can yet remedy the situation, no?~
@1347 = ~It is possible. But then, you are still a child in elven years, not a woman grown... oh, Seldarine, what have I done?! You are a child, still a child...~
@1348 = ~Hey, I am a Bhaalspawn. Normal man-woman definitions cannot be applied to us.~
@1349 = ~Yes, Xan, how could you? Tsk, tsk. Shame on you!~
@1350 = ~Well, I do not see how it can be repaired. We'll have to live with what we have done.~
@1351 = ~You are right, but still I feel uneasy. But it cannot be helped, I suppose.~
@1352 = ~And your behavior proves it, as well. Now, what do I do with you?~
@1353 = ~I have quite a few ideas, none of them suitable for public...~
@1354 = ~Beg my forgiveness a thousand times and say you will never touch me again?~
@1355 = ~No remorse in your voice at all, I see. (sigh) Women...~
@1356 = ~Then, I beg of you, save it for a... private discourse.~
@1357 = ~I will tell you what I intended to say in the first place, then.~
@1358 = ~What I am interested in is not your year of birth, but rather the date. We celebrate births and mourn our dead, but we do not celebrate birthdays every year, like humans do. However, you grew up among them, so I wanted to brighten this day when it would come. But now I see that it is impossible. If the year of your birth is a mystery, the date itself must be murkier, still.~
@1359 = ~Thank you for the thought, anyway. It was very sweet of you.~
@1360 = ~But we could celebrate it any day! Tonight, for example.~
@1361 = ~We may pick a day and pronounce it my birthday.~
@1362 = ~I am not interested in such rubbish as birthdays.~
@1363 = ~I only wish to see you happy. It is futile to pursue happiness, but with so much darkness around you, you need a small sip of sunshine. If it comforts you tonight, I will be content.~
@1364 = ~Then... then tonight we will. I am afraid that you'll have no fireworks, but I shall do my best.~
@1365 = ~Will tonight suffice?~
@1366 = ~Tonight it is, then.~
@1367 = ~No, I am not in the mood.~
@1368 = ~Are you indeed? Even if they involve ice, fire and magic treasure?~
@1369 = ~Magic treasure? All right, bring it on!~
@1370 = ~No, I am still against it.~
@1371 = ~Tonight.~
@1372 = ~I only wish to see you happy. I know that it is futile to pursue happiness, but with so much darkness around you, you need a small sip of sunshine.~
@1373 = ~I will not force-feed it to you, but I will ask you again tonight, even at the risk of being blasted to smithereens.~
@1374 = ~You haven't changed your mind, have you? No, that would be too much to hope for.~ [O#XAN084]
@1375 = ~About my birthday? No, I haven't! We are celebrating it right now!~
@1376 = ~I am in no mood for celebrations.~
@1377 = ~Huh? What?~
@1378 = ~Your birthday, <CHARNAME>. I was so foolish as to propose to celebrate it tonight. Have you forgotten? Did I tell you at all?~
@1379 = ~Oh. Of course, let's celebrate it!~
@1380 = ~I am sorry, but not tonight.~
@1381 = ~No, and I am not in the mood.~
@1382 = ~It would have been a poor one, in any case. And probably the last one.~
@1383 = ~It may be your last one, but never mind. While I cannot grant you life eternal, or hasten Irenicus' demise, I want to make this night remarkable for you. Make a wish, and I will fulfill it the best I can.~
@1384 = ~Can I wish for anything?~
@1385 = ~But there is nothing I need. Not with you by my side.~
@1386 = ~I doubt you can fulfill it.~
@1387 = ~Anything you want - if it is in my power to accomplish, I will.~
@1388 = ~I appreciate that, Estel'amin. More than you think. But still, if you have something you cannot live without, name it.~
@1389 = ~If it concerns you and only you, I will try.~
@1390 = ~What will it be?~
@1391 = ~When I look at you, there is nothing else I can think of. Love.~
@1392 = ~Power. Can you make me more powerful?~
@1393 = ~I want to know a shameful secret about you, a secret you otherwise would not reveal.~
@1394 = ~A magic item of great renown.~
@1395 = ~Knowledge. I wish to learn some information of great importance.~
@1396 = ~Fresh strawberries, cream, some other exotic delicacies... wait, I'll give you a list.~
@1397 = ~Only one wish?~
@1398 = ~For once, we are in full agreement about the matter.~
@1399 = ~No. You progress faster than me, either because of your talent or your divine heritage. I am afraid that you will have to choose again.~
@1400 = ~And what is it that you do not know about me? During our travels, I have told you everything I can think of, save possibly for... oh. (sigh) Yes, there is something you would like to know, and laugh at me through the next year, I presume.~
@1401 = ~It happened twenty years ago. I was performing a small mission far north. Incidentally, it ended in disaster, as I expected, but that is irrelevant to the story. Elves were rare in the settlement, and thus, with my unusual looks, I was getting an undue amount of female attention.~
@1402 = ~Where exactly is this place? I'd like to wipe it from existence.~
@1403 = ~You still receive a great amount of female attention, and I cannot say I like it.~
@1404 = ~Didn't you enjoy it?~
@1405 = ~Interesting. Go on.~
@1406 = ~There is no point. From what I heard, it was buried under an avalanche a month after I departed - my good luck of sorts. Still, I do not understand your sudden bloodlust.~
@1407 = ~You are flattering me. But on with the story.~
@1408 = ~It is hard to enjoy a woman's attention, knowing she would wither and die in a few decades. Though your destiny is sadder and shorter than any human's, I fear.~
@1409 = ~One of the human girls was bolder than the others, and as she worked in the inn where I was staying, she had every opportunity to tamper with my food. She did. I trust you know what a large dose of guril berries can do to a man?~
@1410 = ~Oh.~
@1411 = ~Serves you right.~
@1412 = ~And... er... what did you do?~
@1413 = ~No, I have no idea.~
@1414 = ~They invoke strong physical desire, and I assure you that once taken against one's will, it does not produce a pleasant sensation.~
@1415 = ~I admit that I was incautious, but when I realized what she had done, there was no way to repair the damage. I could not think well, so I did the first thing that came into my head: ran out into the snow.~
@1416 = ~It was my bad luck that a snowstorm started at the same time, and I got lost within moments. The berries' effect passed, but I had a worse problem: to survive. Out in the snow, without as much as a cloak, it was a task doomed to fail. Instead of staying in the same place, I soon stumbled out into the wilderness, where I could not even protect myself with the simplest of spells, as my fingers were frozen. I lived through the night, but I retained most unpleasant memories about the event.~
@1417 = ~But why didn't you run to the girl instead?~
@1418 = ~And what happened to her?~
@1419 = ~Quite a story. Thank you.~
@1420 = ~<CHARNAME>, love can be offered or given, but not bought or forced. (sigh) Humans will never understand it, it seems.~
@1421 = ~I do not know for sure; I departed early in the next morning, as soon as I had found the way back to the inn.~
@1422 = ~But I have rambled enough. Rest, <CHARNAME>; dangerous days are ahead.~
@1423 = ~Then you will have it.~
@1424 = ~All my belongings are now hopelessly lost, but I was able to track this one. Do not ask me how; all that matters that it is yours.~
@1425 = ~And it matches your helmet, as well.~
@1426 = ~Knowledge often does more harm than good. You have asked for a dangerous gift; won't you reconsider and choose again?~
@1427 = ~Not in this lifetime. I want to know.~
@1428 = ~No, I won't.~
@1429 = ~Yes, I suppose I will.~
@1430 = ~You will, and you will regret asking me. But very well: listen.~
@1431 = ~On my way to Athkatla, I met a traveling bard in a wayside inn. He was born in Saradush, and told me a story about a girl from that city. As soon as I heard the first lines, I thought about you, and the foreboding did not let me go until the last lines had been spoken; I felt there was some connection. In any case, I hope you will find the story useful, since it indicates the location of a treasure trove.~
@1432 = ~The girl in question was a talented mage, who greatly desired to become an adventurer. However, as every adventuring fool, she also took unnecessary risks at every turn, even if her family and betrothed asked otherwise.~
@1433 = ~One day, she overstepped the line. She got wind of a vampire coven near the docks and decided to check for herself if the rumors were true. Perhaps she did not want to destroy the monsters as much as to search for the treasure, but it is only a thought.~
@1434 = ~In any case, she succeeded, and destroyed nearly all of them. She got fame, reward and the townsfolk's appreciation. But a year later, the vampire queen returned.~
@1435 = ~The sentient undead possess great cunning due to their long unlife, and this one was no exception. She entered the heroine's home at night and stole her betrothed, subsequently turning him into a fledgling vampire. When the girl woke and traced them to the crypts, all she could do was to slay the pair by her own hand.~
@1436 = ~As the story goes, she lived a long life afterwards, but spent half of the time in the crypts, where she died in the end and was buried in her mage attire, some of which rivaled the best of what the Adventurer's Mart could offer. The irony of it was that several years after her death, vampires returned again and despoiled most graves, including her own. The bard hinted that the monsters might be there, still.~
@1437 = ~So, my dear Bhaalspawn, be careful when fighting vampires. They are inventive in their revenge.~
@1438 = ~Ah, that's a relief. I feared you would ask me for the staff of Vecna himself or the like. Fortunately, my magic can stretch this far.~
@1439 = ~My power is limited, <CHARNAME>. It would be unfortunate if I showered you with gifts but died of exhaustion shortly afterwards, don't you think?~
@1440 = ~I should hope you are glad that you have got your wish. Have a very happy birthday, <CHARNAME>.~
@1441 = ~I have been wondering: what if we had centuries at our disposal? Where would we be?~ [O#XAN085]
@1442 = ~In heaven.~
@1443 = ~We could be living among humans, like we do now. Athkatla is as good as any other.~
@1444 = ~I'd like us to mingle with citizens of an elven encampment. We are elves, after all.~
@1445 = ~You and me. Together. Alone.~
@1446 = ~Where, where... In a fairy tale! There are no 'ifs'. There is only now.~
@1447 = ~You are mirroring my thoughts again. But if it is possible, for how long?~
@1448 = ~I feared you would say this. Why, <CHARNAME>? What do you see in this hole? Leave humans to their greed and their doom. Don't you prefer your own kin?~
@1449 = ~I know little of them. But if they accept me, I would like it.~
@1450 = ~No, I prefer the life in the big city.~
@1451 = ~I do not care either way. To be with you is enough for me.~
@1452 = ~I am sure you would have been accepted, had no danger accompanied you. You are one of us, no matter who your sire was.~
@1453 = ~Ah, but I am in two minds about it. Having no neighbors in the vicinity reduces the chances of being dragged into another war, but a lone cabin in the wilderness is more likely to attract attention, and therefore, danger.~
@1454 = ~I know this, but dream with me. Close your eyes and tell me: where would you like to be?~
@1455 = ~With you. Nothing else matters.~
@1456 = ~Among our kin.~
@1457 = ~In a large and bustling human city.~
@1458 = ~Away from the human crowds. Just the two of us.~
@1459 = ~I really do not want to think about this.~
@1460 = ~I more than understand. Let us move on, then, and see if we actually have a future.~
@1461 = ~Sometimes I wonder how I came to be with you, when we are so different. Then I look at you, and the thought melts.~
@1462 = ~I wish to live and die beside you, but I am much older than you. What will you do when I die?~
@1463 = ~I haven't given it much thought, yet.~
@1464 = ~Is our age difference that great?~
@1465 = ~I will find another lover, I guess.~
@1466 = ~How old are you?~
@1467 = ~You will have to think on it, I'm afraid.~
@1468 = ~I do not know, as I do not know when you were born. The Year of Beckoning Death? The Year of the Dusty Throne? The Year of the Killing Wave?~
@1469 = ~Or the Year of the Raging Flame? Your destructive skills qualify, I suppose.~
@1470 = ~Or the Year of Silent Steel? It fits with your profession well.~
@1471 = ~Then it will be the least of my worries. If you are going to be happy after I pass away, I am content, if bitter. I got used to the fact that we shall never meet in Arvandor, otherwise... but there is no otherwise.~
@1472 = ~I was born in the Year of the Guardian. If you do not remember the Roll of Years, it means that we have over a century between us. It also means that I will pass away much earlier than you, if we are ever allowed to live our lives peacefully. We will not, so it is little more than a fantasy. But even in a fantasy, we are separated, divided, forced to break apart. Even in a fantasy, we have no future.~
@1473 = ~Isn't two hundred years together or more a future to you?~
@1474 = ~No. We have no future, and the Doom of Everything is near. Let us lie down and die.~
@1475 = ~We have today, we have tomorrow, and guess what? We may even have a day after tomorrow! Aren't we rich?~
@1476 = ~You are seeing horrors everywhere. It will be much, much better, trust me.~
@1477 = ~You are right. It is so pointless...~
@1478 = ~It is not. I will be punished for desiring too much, I know, but I wish an eternity with you.~
@1479 = ~<CHARNAME>, when will you start taking things seriously?~
@1480 = ~You keep saying the same things...~
@1481 = ~Because you keep asking the same questions!~
@1482 = ~No, you do. If I hear "we're all doomed" one more time, Irenicus will become the least of your worries.~
@1483 = ~Look who is talking, sir Life-Is-So-Hollow!~
@1484 = ~There is nothing I can do about it: it is the truth.~
@1485 = ~No. No, it is not. Not while you are still with me.~
@1486 = ~I made a mistake by speaking of our ages. By the look of you, the discovery was not to your liking.~ [O#XAN086]
@1487 = ~Yes, I thought that the phrase "they lived happily ever after" normally works. With you, it doesn't.~
@1488 = ~I am a Bhaalspawn, Xan. What is age for me? I shall not live long.~
@1489 = ~We are powerful. With power comes longevity. We can lengthen our lifespans.~
@1490 = ~Not to disappoint you or anything, but people tend to get upset when speaking of death, you know?~
@1491 = ~I do not think it's important.~
@1492 = ~Ah, of course: with me, nothing can end well. Why, thank you kindly, <CHARNAME>. I should have expected this of you.~
@1493 = ~No, but even if you do, you will be forced to do so without me. You will find another lover, abandon my memory entirely...~
@1494 = ~How? By meddling in Necromancy? Severing my link with Arvandor? Szass Tam, the current ruler of Thay, tried this: he was born a year earlier than me, and now he continues his existence as a lich. But, by Seldarine, I shall not touch those arts!~
@1495 = ~Ah, of course: I speak only of death and make your life a living hell. Obviously. How have you been able to tolerate my presence so far, I wonder?~
@1496 = ~Ah, of course. Why would my life be important to you?~
@1497 = ~(sigh) I am sorry, <CHARNAME>. I am fuming inside, but fuming only at myself. I shouldn't have released it on you. It is not your fault that I have been born earlier... not your fault that I met you so late...~
@1498 = ~Shhh... Look, I am young, beautiful, and not going anywhere. Isn't it nice?~
@1499 = ~Not my fault, and not yours.~
@1500 = ~I'd rather you did not speak to me in this tone again.~
@1501 = ~By the way, what were you doing before you met me? I am interested.~
@1502 = ~(sigh) It is perfect.~
@1503 = ~Still, it was unreasonable of me.~
@1504 = ~I will not, of course. I am sorry.~
@1505 = ~You have not confused me with our mutual acquaintance, Coran, by chance? No, <CHARNAME>, I left no trail of broken hearts and split families, if you are so interested.~
@1506 = ~No elven maiden who awaited the hero's return?~
@1507 = ~But there was somebody else, was there?~
@1508 = ~Were you not an offspring of Bhaal, I would have thought you in kinship with Erevan Ilesere, the Trickster God. Your constant teasing is worse than his practical jokes are rumored to be. My distant kin, Erevain Blacksheaf, who later perished in Icewind Dale, was named in his honor...~
@1509 = ~And no, I am not going to tell you.~
@1510 = ~I should be kissing your hair, not blaming you or your destiny. But I cannot treat the flow of time the way humans do: instead of steering it, I am drowning.~
@1511 = ~Forgive me; I'd rather be alone for a while.~
@1512 = ~I should not have done that.~ [O#XAN087]
@1513 = ~Yes, it sounded strange when you brooded about your unfortunate fate. Some of us here are Bhaalspawn, and have no life or afterlife whatsoever.~
@1514 = ~Finally realized that my condition is even sadder than yours, have you?~
@1515 = ~Done what?~
@1516 = ~Xan, stop right here! Another round of musing about the imperfection of this world, and I will go insane!~
@1517 = ~Oh, but it is not about the world. I was talking of you, and your sad future.~
@1518 = ~I shouldn't have complained about my future. When I consider yours, mine looks bright indeed.~
@1519 = ~I did not want to remind you of it, since it could cripple your spirit. Perhaps I was moaning about my problems only to take your mind off yours, no? (sigh) But it does not help. So, here it is, the unavoidable fact: you will die in the Bhaalspawn wars, and there is no afterlife for you. Both your mind and your spirit will be destroyed utterly.~
@1520 = ~I know that, and I am fine. There is no need to remind me.~
@1521 = ~I am aware of it, and it breaks my heart.~
@1522 = ~Is it true?~
@1523 = ~No, Xan. The Bhaalspawn wars will finish, and I will emerge victorious!~
@1524 = ~What Bhaalspawn wars?~
@1525 = ~Are you being fatalistic, careless, naive or simply indifferent?~
@1526 = ~What will come will come.~
@1527 = ~I am being op-ti-mis-tic. Do you know the word? Nah, of course you don't.~
@1528 = ~I believe that everything will be all right.~
@1529 = ~I am a child of a god! What can possibly happen to me?~
@1530 = ~This is an answer in itself, I suppose.~
@1531 = ~Yes, and trust me, you will not like it.~
@1532 = ~(groan) You are hopeless.~
@1533 = ~No - please, do not break down. If you do, you will die. And the world without you is no world at all.~
@1534 = ~Are you telling me to be strong? I am just a mortal woman, Xan, no matter who my sire was. I cannot.~
@1535 = ~What is the point, if I am doomed anyway?~
@1536 = ~You are right. I must survive, and I will.~
@1537 = ~But you have me. You have at least one reason to go on - or I would hope so. I do not think it will give you strength, but it will prevent you from falling apart.~
@1538 = ~Hmm... you know, it just might.~
@1539 = ~I think it is the best reason there is.~
@1540 = ~No, Xan, it won't help.~
@1541 = ~But we are together, and we are not dead yet. For me, it is a reason enough. And for you... you are not alone. I am with you, caring about you... loving you, no matter what happens afterwards. When everything fails, remember this.~
@1542 = ~That's the spirit. (sigh) Sometimes I am grateful that you have this inflexible optimism of yours.~
@1543 = ~Why would I lie to you? You saw your half-brother crumbling to dust. He does not exist any more - or, if he does, he suffers in the plane of your sire. There is no other outcome.~
@1544 = ~It is terrible!~
@1545 = ~I'll live with that.~
@1546 = ~There is. I will kill my other siblings, and be the last one standing!~
@1547 = ~Ah, so dragons will fall beneath your feet, rivers of lava will come down and bury your enemies, and your siblings will run as soon as they hear the booming sound of your steps. You'll be forging a spiky armor next. Or are you going to crush them with the Seldarine's blessing, hoping to join the pantheon in the near future? It is hopeless.~
@1548 = ~It is not. Look at us, Xan! We killed a Red Dragon!~
@1549 = ~It is not. Look at us, Xan! We killed a Shadow Dragon!~
@1550 = ~It is not. Look at us, Xan! We killed a Demi-Lich!~
@1551 = ~It is not. Look at us, Xan! We killed everyone who stood in our way! Liches, Dragons, undead - they stand no chance against us!~
@1552 = ~We are powerful, and lucky. I know we'll win.~
@1553 = ~(sigh) It may be that you are right.~
@1554 = ~Just because you were lucky once does not mean you will be lucky all the time. It is only a matter of time before our next adversary has our heads on a pike - or in a tentacle.~
@1555 = ~Just because you were lucky once... twice... three times in a row... oh, have it your way. But it will not end well, mark my words.~
@1556 = ~You have displayed your power and luck against goblins and kobolds, but what will happen once you find a real adversary? It can only end in disaster.~
@1557 = ~How many of your siblings do you think are alive? And how many are aware of what they are? How many would want to claim their heritage? And lastly, how many of them are more powerful than you?~
@1558 = ~No matter how powerful, I'll crush them all!~
@1559 = ~Oh dear. I am dead! Doomed!~
@1560 = ~I'll manage somehow. It's not the end of the world.~
@1561 = ~I do not know why I am telling you this. No warning, no warding words will help you now. But I want you to know that I am with you, caring about you... always, no matter what happens afterwards. When everything fails, remember this.~
@1562 = ~We have talked of death long enough. Shall we speak of happier things?~ [O#XAN088]
@1563 = ~Well, I say it's about time!~
@1564 = ~Why not?~
@1565 = ~I prefer to talk about death, sorrow and destruction. It is so inspiring!~
@1566 = ~All right, though I do not mind either way.~
@1567 = ~My poor <CHARNAME>. I wearied you to the bone, did I not? But to<DAYNIGHT> you will get your wish.~
@1568 = ~Oh, I remember that you are a kindred spirit. But while I promise more heart-weeping sessions in the nearest future, I will not bear it happening every day, and neither will you.~
@1569 = ~We miss so many opportunities to stop, look and listen. I would dance with you in the starlight, ride in a boat along the Singing Waters, look at the Anauroch desert over your shoulder, love you in our own home.~
@1570 = ~For now, it is little more than a dream, but if... when... if... (sigh) If we survive, if we live through Irenicus, through your siblings, through the fire and hurt - we will have the world at our disposal. I promise you this.~
@1571 = ~The world? Sounds good.~
@1572 = ~I don't know if I want this. All these things are rather mundane. What about a kingdom or two?~
@1573 = ~Keep dreaming.~
@1574 = ~Not in the material sense of the word. Though I believe we could have both, in a way.~
@1575 = ~Ironically, you could have one.~
@1576 = ~With you, I do. You taught me to dream, and to cherish every day passed. Thank you.~
@1577 = ~You see, the original purpose of the moonblades was to choose the sole ruler among the elves. Hundreds of blades were forged, but over the centuries many became dormant, as their wielders produced no worthy heirs. In the end, the number of the moonblades fell to twenty one, the prophesied number, and all holders were summoned to choose this proverbial ruler. Not all were able to attend, but from those who did, Zaor Moonflower was made king.~
@1578 = ~It happened before I was even born, but had the events turned out differently, you would have been the Queen of Evermeet. Now, have I gratified your vanity?~
@1579 = ~And where had your sire been at the time? He should have secured the throne for you!~
@1580 = ~I am a child of a god! It's much better than being a Queen, in my opinion.~
@1581 = ~What is the point in the moonblades now, then?~
@1582 = ~You are not a king, but you are still nobility, are you not?~
@1583 = ~Yes, it was an interesting story.~
@1584 = ~With a boring story? No, you haven't.~
@1585 = ~Our family lore tells that he was chasing orcs near Evereska. A small elven settlement was saved, but since he failed to attend the ceremony in time, he was probably considered a disappointment among our kin.~
@1586 = ~And much more dangerous. Zaor was assassinated in the end, and he was attacked only half a dozen times. You are assaulted daily.~
@1587 = ~It is a symbol of protection, and for the naive - a symbol of nobility, fame and adventure. A moonblade wielder is even called Defender of Elvendom by some. I do not believe our small number will change Elvendom's fate, however. We're all doomed.~
@1588 = ~I should have expected you to ask this. Royalty, nobility, lineage - what is the point in these? A notorious name will not shield you from an arrow; it will only subject you to worse tortures at the hands of the orcs. We're all doomed, regardless of our heritage.~
@1589 = ~And as every story does, it ended in tragedy, since Zaor was assassinated about fifty years ago, and with his death, betrayal entered Evermeet. We've yet to see the worst of it, I'm afraid.~
@1590 = ~This 'boring story' claimed hundreds of lives. But have it your way.~
@1591 = ~But it is high time we were on the road again, don't you think?~
@1592 = ~Many of our kin spend time away from each other, to make their time together more precious. But we are doomed to become a rare exception.~ [O#XAN089]
@1593 = ~Is it a good thing or a bad thing?~
@1594 = ~Why 'doomed'? Staying together is good, is it not?~
@1595 = ~A pity, that. I'd like us to follow different paths for a while.~
@1596 = ~Yes, Irenicus has seen to that.~
@1597 = ~Your company is the most beautiful thing I have in this world. There are others, but you are the first in my heart.~
@1598 = ~You may grow weary of my company after a while. But it is unlikely: we will not have that much time.~
@1599 = ~As you wish, so it will be. But it is too dangerous for the moment: you have many enemies, both open and hidden. I do not want to abandon you to their mercy.~
@1600 = ~Not only he. Even without that madman, you have many enemies, open and hidden. I do not want to abandon you to their mercy.~
@1601 = ~(sigh) No. I do not want to abandon you at all.~
@1602 = ~A year ago, in the treetops of the Cloudpeaks, I asked you to become my wife in the eyes of the People. A formal union is required... in my case.~
@1603 = ~Why?~
@1604 = ~And I am still willing.~
@1605 = ~I said 'no' back then, and I repeat it again.~
@1606 = ~I did not want to marry you back then, but I changed my mind.~
@1607 = ~There are rituals, and traditions. The nobility you seem to be so keen to hear about is the main reason. I would not want my House to be gossiped about, though your heritage alone would provide Everaskan loafers with enough food for such.~
@1608 = ~<CHARNAME>... thank you.~
@1609 = ~<CHARNAME>, nothing is required of you.~
@1610 = ~What was the reason, I wonder?~
@1611 = ~I missed you when I was captured, and promised myself to marry you, should you ask again.~
@1612 = ~I thought a lot, and decided that I was hasty back then.~
@1613 = ~I simply want to make you happier.~
@1614 = ~Nothing in particular.~
@1615 = ~Does it mean that you have grown wiser? I should hope so.~
@1616 = ~My chaotic and unpredictable <CHARNAME>. (sigh) How have I come to love my exact opposite?~
@1617 = ~However, it is still impossible. It takes too much time. The ceremony begins on the night of the full moon, and ends three days after the night of the crescent moon. Days before the wedding should be spent in feasts and reflection, and we have neither inclination for the former nor time for the latter. As well, neither of us has parents to petition... and no temple to direct our steps to...~
@1618 = ~Do not despair, Xan. We may stumble upon an elven city, or meet a traveling elven priest.~
@1619 = ~You look so lost... Is there anything I can do?~
@1620 = ~Does it really matter? It is just a ceremony.~
@1621 = ~Quite a ritual, I see. Could you tell me more?~
@1622 = ~No, there is no hope for that.~
@1623 = ~If you will, just stay here, so I can feel your breath on my cheek... touch your hair... hear your voice... You are so beautiful...~
@1624 = ~It would not matter as much, were we able to commit ourselves to each other any moment. But now, away from Evereska, it suddenly matters.~
@1625 = ~What do you wish to know? The wines our people drink? The vows they take? The songs they sing? I am a poor performer, and an even worse listener, so you should not rely on my memories. You will see for yourself, if we live that long.~
@1626 = ~One thing I remember clearly, however. It is called the seeding: the couple plants two trees in a single hole. A spell is uttered by the two as they hold hands, the priest takes the sacramental ribbon from them and ties it around the trees, at which point the two trees become one. The tree grows, blossoms, and rains blossoms on the wedding party. These trees are rumored to live as long as the couple stays married. In our case, the tree would not live long, as one or both of us - no, do not look at me like this, I will say it anyway - will die very soon.~
@1627 = ~I will never be able to completely give myself to you. I will die, we shall get separated, your heritage will claim you, and our enemies will bury us together. (sigh) Seldarine, why do I keep wishing for the impossible?~
@1628 = ~Love is just another word for fear, and as days go by, I feel both increasing. Do you?~ [O#XAN090]
@1629 = ~I do. I love you, and fear for you, as well.~
@1630 = ~Not fear. Love, yes, but I am not afraid.~
@1631 = ~It stays the same for me.~
@1632 = ~I think that my feelings for you were stronger before.~
@1633 = ~I'd rather not discuss this.~
@1634 = ~But of course. May I have your hand as we walk, then?~
@1635 = ~We are alike in this. I wonder if my heart will simply give up one day? One cannot carry that much emotion within; I almost feel it breaking at times.~
@1636 = ~You should be. What will happen once we are no longer together? If you do not fear this, you are not ready for the loss. You may break once it happens.~
@1637 = ~But without you, I would not want to survive.~
@1638 = ~It will never happen, no matter what you say.~
@1639 = ~Who knows? My outlook may help me, not hurt me.~
@1640 = ~<CHARNAME>... do not say this.~
@1641 = ~It will. But let us not talk of this.~
@1642 = ~You may be right... I pray it does. But let us not talk of this.~
@1643 = ~Truly? Did neither time, nor danger, nor continual growth of your talents, nor new people around us change anything?~
@1644 = ~No, I think not.~
@1645 = ~Why would they? Love is constant, and unchangeable.~
@1646 = ~If you put it like that, my feelings for you grew stronger.~
@1647 = ~I did not want to disappoint you, but I love you less now.~
@1648 = ~Do you, like most humans, think that love is sweeter when just born? I will never accept it. With every moment, every phrase, I know and love you better. The memories will turn to dust in the nearest future, but such is our fate.~
@1649 = ~Love is not constant. It changes just as you do. Where is the frightened girl in a tattered cloak, just out of the library walls? Where is the young woman, shocked by the discovery of her true heritage? You have changed, and so have our feelings.~
@1650 = ~It is peculiar how our love transcended for the past year. When I think of the day I met you, it seems like it happened in another universe. So much has passed; but the memory stands clearly in my mind.~
@1651 = ~I know it should be our first meeting that I should remember, but in truth, your first words and our consequent journey to the surface were a tangled blur in my head. But then we stepped into the sun, I opened my mouth to thank you, and I saw your face.~
@1652 = ~I do not know what I said to you, and neither do I recall what you answered, but from that moment on, something shifted in my soul. Was it love? I am not sure, but I know that I was never able to look at you in the same way again. From <CHARNAME> who saved me, you became <CHARNAME> of my dreams.~
@1653 = ~How very romantic.~
@1654 = ~So, was it love at first sight?~
@1655 = ~And what do you feel now?~
@1656 = ~What utter rubbish! And boring, too.~
@1657 = ~It was not; it was a frightening feeling. I am an Enchanter, and being in full control of my emotions is essential for my art. Even though I did not avoid female company before meeting you, I would never allow myself to fall so completely, so utterly. It is too dangerous, too unpredictable... But I am rambling again.~
@1658 = ~Love.~
@1659 = ~Were those days boring for you? You must find our current struggle interesting, then. (sigh) You will never cease to amaze me, it seems.~
@1660 = ~What was it like for you? If I might ask... what did you feel at the time of our first meeting?~
@1661 = ~It was strange... my heart stopped for the moment, and when it went on, things already were different.~
@1662 = ~You were standing alone in the cave, so small and lonely... I felt sorry for you.~
@1663 = ~I thought that you looked gorgeous. And I still do.~
@1664 = ~I fell in love with your voice at first word.~
@1665 = ~I did not feel anything, really. It all started later.~
@1666 = ~Was it truly meant to be, then? But we will never know.~
@1667 = ~You felt pity, and it miraculously transformed into love... I am lucky it did, I suppose.~
@1668 = ~If you would show me tonight...~
@1669 = ~(sigh) It is good to know there is at least one aspect of me you do like.~
@1670 = ~You behaved like a wise person should. Why was I unable to do the same?~
@1671 = ~I wonder how it was before, without you.~ [O#XAN091]
@1672 = ~Don't you remember?~
@1673 = ~It was lonely and cold, I suppose.~
@1674 = ~More freedom, more choice, more chances of enjoying yourself...~
@1675 = ~I do. But that life was empty - and only now do I realize how hollow it was.~
@1676 = ~More than you can imagine. But you can, of course.~
@1677 = ~Yes, everything you say makes sense - if one ignores the abyss between love and indifference.~
@1678 = ~Love is not a feeling. It is another sense of the world, another dimension, another spiritual connection, as important as the Elven Spirit itself. I was deaf when I did not love, and blind when I denied it. Now I live, and I owe it to you.~
@1679 = ~I dread to think about the life you led at Candlekeep. You were denied everything except books, chores and mindless training. You were deprived of love, as well, were you not?~
@1680 = ~I had Gorion. He loved me back then.~
@1681 = ~There was Imoen. She never let me down.~
@1682 = ~I had friends, and acquaintances. I was not lonely.~
@1683 = ~Well... No!~
@1684 = ~True. I had no one.~
@1685 = ~I do not doubt it, though I wish he told you of your heritage earlier. But it was different.~
@1686 = ~I am sure she did not, however you behaved. But it was different.~
@1687 = ~<CHARNAME>, <CHARNAME>... weren't you listening?~
@1688 = ~I suspected as much. You deserved so much more than a backwater library and the company of the unconcerned... But I swear, you will never be alone again.~
@1689 = ~Promise?~
@1690 = ~Oh, yes. My sire has ensured that I will never have a lack of enemies.~
@1691 = ~I am used to being alone, so do not worry.~
@1692 = ~Did that feeling make your world shine in every dimension? Did it turn all your perceptions of the Multiverse upside down? Did it make you radiate unconditional love at every step of the way? No, I am sure it did not.~
@1693 = ~Xan, you are a hopeless romantic. Wait, and reality will set your head right.~
@1694 = ~It did, and I remember it fondly.~
@1695 = ~It did not. But now... now it does.~
@1696 = ~You underestimate friendship and family. These are different kinds of love.~
@1697 = ~It will set it dead, I do not doubt.~
@1698 = ~It is a pity that this feeling is meant to die.~
@1699 = ~These days, I have no family to care about, but I remember how it was. It was a warm and calm feeling, quite unlike the blaze of emotions I am experiencing now.~
@1700 = ~But you are right, I suppose: however dissimilar, all love is doomed to fail.~
@1701 = ~Yes.~
@1702 = ~But I will ensure that you will never have the lack of love. One may extinguish the other... though in truth, I have no doubt as to which side wins.~
@1703 = ~One day, you will regret this. Being alone is a wearing experience, and I should know. But live as you will.~
@1704 = ~It is a pity that this memory, together with the others, is meant to die.~
@1705 = ~I've been happy these past days. But do I have the right to be? I, the moonblade wielder, bonded to the Child of Bhaal and doomed to die as surely as the moon rises each night?~ [O#XAN092]
@1706 = ~Everyone has a right to some happiness. You are no exception.~
@1707 = ~It is difficult to be happy in these circumstances, I agree.~
@1708 = ~Are you berating me?~
@1709 = ~Xan, please... not to<DAYNIGHT>.~
@1710 = ~I am not speaking about happiness as a brief respite. After the horrors we came through, even the cruellest destiny would allow us a break. But do we deserve to be happy permanently?~
@1711 = ~It should be impossible, but I am happy. More than that, I cherish the impossible hope that you will live, and I will survive at your side.~
@1712 = ~Why would you think so? Ah, I mentioned you as a Child of Bhaal. No, I did not berate you. Far from it. It is your misfortune, but not your fault.~
@1713 = ~No? Very well, I apologize for disturbing your mood.~
@1714 = ~Dare I hope for a happy ending? Do I have a right to think that the light I see in my dreams is not the flame of an approaching dragon, but a promise of recovery to come? Will it ever happen, <CHARNAME>?~
@1715 = ~With my heritage? I think not.~
@1716 = ~Will it? Have you counted our enemies recently?~
@1717 = ~Well, you have a moonblade, and we both know what happens to moonblade wielders after they die...~
@1718 = ~It will. So says <CHARNAME>.~
@1719 = ~I cannot promise you anything, but I hope for a happy ending, too.~
@1720 = ~I should not have said it's a misfortune that you are a Child of Bhaal. It is a disaster.~
@1721 = ~Oh, I did not bother; there were too many.~
@1722 = ~It is not the worst. The worst is giving up your soul to the darkness, feeding your hungry fiend of a father. My possible fate is better than what yours will ever be.~
@1723 = ~Ah, but while you are beautiful, your words alone have no power to convince me, I'm afraid. Still, I am glad that we share this notion.~
@1724 = ~Our likeness will never cease to amaze me. Thank you for sharing this hope.~
@1725 = ~It was so simple before: one armed stranger, and your unknown past. Now it is simple again, but in a different way. Back then, our fate was uncertain, but I kept insisting that we were doomed. Now, our future is decided, but I hold fast to every possible hope. How ironic it is.~
@1726 = ~No, it is foolish. If we are doomed, there is no point in hope.~
@1727 = ~No, it is wise. If we keep hoping, we may survive.~
@1728 = ~I cannot help it. It may be pointless, as you say, but should I give up, die and leave you awaiting your doom, instead? No. I would not fight for myself, but I will fight for you.~
@1729 = ~Or we shall die earlier. Gods enjoy cruel, dark humor; they give hope and withdraw it at the last moment. It is a joke they are likely to watch closely - and they are watching you very closely indeed.~
@1730 = ~Yes, I have noticed your reproachful glance; it is time to go, I know. Let us move on, then, and see if my hopes are as foolish as I think them to be. To the happy ending - or the bloody finale.~
@1731 = ~Mmm...~ [O#XAN093]
@1732 = ~Wake up, lazy one! Time to go!~
@1733 = ~Xan? Did you sleep, not reverie?~
@1734 = ~Yes, resting a little longer is a good idea.~
@1735 = ~Ah, the dawn... or is it sunset? Regardless, it is breaking, and I am still alive. Truly, this world is full of surprises. But my head... oooohhhhh, by the feel of it, it is going to split in two.~
@1736 = ~Good morning to you, or whatever it is. Time to go, don't you think?~
@1737 = ~Looks like somebody has slept overlong.~
@1738 = ~Did you sleep, not reverie?~
@1739 = ~If you are unwell and need rest, we can stay here.~
@1740 = ~I could not... (yawn) agree more.~
@1741 = ~Could we rest a little longer? I... do not feel well.~
@1742 = ~What is it?~
@1743 = ~Not surprisingly. You slept instead of resting like we elves do, and now look at you! A drunk Beholder looks better!~
@1744 = ~No wonder you do. You're wounded!~
@1745 = ~Of course, Xan. I am sure we'll all benefit from it.~
@1746 = ~A drunk Beholder? Why, thank you kindly, melamin. I always knew I could rely on words of comfort in an hour of need.~
@1747 = ~What? Oh, never mind. A potion or two, and it will heal; though it will not hinder our enemies from killing me today, I'll wager. No, it is all inside my head.~
@1748 = ~I fell into reverie first, but old nightmares resurfaced again. It is rather a bother to look at Sarevok's face for the hundredth time, so I turned to sleep. However, there were no soothing dreams for me there, either. Though it was beautiful...~
@1749 = ~Beautiful? What was it about?~
@1750 = ~I never thought you could recall a nightmare with such a dreamy face.~
@1751 = ~Let's just go.~
@1752 = ~I recalled your face from the dream, and it was beautiful. Though the dream was not.~
@1753 = ~About you, of course.~
@1754 = ~You were standing in a beautiful Elven city, on a talan awash with newborn leaves, alone. I saw an ephemeral shape of a building behind you; it was of elven design, but unusual, and quite unlike the marble spires of Evereska.~
@1755 = ~But I quickly forgot about your surroundings, as my gaze returned to you. Your strands of hair were spilled across your face, and a shining trail spiralled down your cheek. You were crying, Estel'amin.~
@1756 = ~Why would I?~
@1757 = ~Nonsense. I never cry.~
@1758 = ~Then... something terrible must have happened...~
@1759 = ~That's enough, really. Let us go.~
@1760 = ~This I know, and it frightened me all the more. What could happen to make you cry?~
@1761 = ~I do not know, and I would not want to. A dream it was, but it frightened me almost as much as if it were real.~
@1762 = ~Now I am exhausted. Would you have us staying here for a while?~
@1763 = ~I am sorry, but our quest is urgent.~
@1764 = ~I do not mind, of course. What you need is rest.~
@1765 = ~Rest... and that is all?~
@1766 = ~Of course. But eager as I am to continue your hopeless quest, I would still like to rest normally. Would you mind staying here for a while?~
@1767 = ~Rest... and that is all?~
@1768 = ~(sigh) Listening and obeying, my impatient leader.~
@1769 = ~To my great disappointment - yes.~
@1770 = ~It is peculiar how we who destroyed bandit camps, flooded mines and cut short war conspiracies are unable to do anything against a band of drunken louts in the next room.~ [O#XAN094]
@1771 = ~Do not bother. They'll probably fall asleep soon.~
@1772 = ~Yes, it's terrible. Can't the Heroes of the Sword Coast get some rest?~
@1773 = ~Go and tell them to shut up, if they upset you so.~
@1774 = ~Right. I don't like it, either. HEY, YOU! CAN'T A BHAALSPAWN GET SOME REST IN HERE?!~
@1775 = ~But since they are not going to retire anytime soon, shall we follow their example?~
@1776 = ~What, throw a big drunk party?~
@1777 = ~Sounds like a good idea!~
@1778 = ~Hmm... I like this proposition.~
@1779 = ~No, I do not feel in the mood.~
@1780 = ~I would, but since my spellbook is nearly empty, I would rather not risk it.~
@1781 = ~Hey, what happened to your natural charms? I bet they won't refuse a simple request.~
@1782 = ~It's a pity. Well, let us hope they'll fall asleep soon.~
@1783 = ~Bah, should I do everything myself? HEY, YOU! A BHAALSPAWN IS COMING TO GET YOU, IF YOU DO NOT SHUT UP!~
@1784 = ~Thank you, <CHARNAME>. Though now my ears are aching even worse...~
@1785 = ~If you insist... Oh, very well. I will be back shortly. Or not.~
@1786 = ~No, melamin, not a big, drunk one. Rather a quieter and a more... private one.~
@1787 = ~So, this night will not be a waste, after all. On the contrary, it is going to be as perfect as one can wish for...~
@1788 = ~(sigh) I see that it is going to be an unpleasant night indeed.~
@1789 = ~You are shivering. This place gets under your skin, as well, does it not?~ [O#XAN095]
@1790 = ~It is dark, disgusting, and dangerous. It is natural that I do not like it.~
@1791 = ~I really don't like it here. I would run away, if I could.~
@1792 = ~No, it's just the chill, I guess.~
@1793 = ~You are having hallucinations. I am fine.~
@1794 = ~Only too natural, I agree. I do not like it myself, to be honest. I suppose it is our elven nature: even years of wandering do not make this aversion fade. With you, however, even this pressing darkness is much easier to bear.~
@1795 = ~You are a great help, too.~
@1796 = ~Why, thank you.~
@1797 = ~Coward.~
@1798 = ~You are flattering me... but thank you.~
@1799 = ~I suppose I am, at that. But a live coward, <CHARNAME>. Note this well.~
@1800 = ~I do not think we can. But tomorrow you will see the sun again - if we are alive at the time, of course. (sigh) I am so tired of repeating this...~
@1801 = ~Then don't. Think of happier things, will you?~
@1802 = ~I hope that we do. If not for you, I would have gone mad in here.~
@1803 = ~Everything will be all right, Xan. (sigh) I am so tired of repeating this...~
@1804 = ~But I am doing so already. With you so near, it is impossible to think of anything else.~
@1805 = ~If your words had power to change anything, I would listen endlessly. But they do not. We are doomed.~
@1806 = ~Is it? Come here, and I'll try to warm you up. Or should I rekindle the fire?~
@1807 = ~Please do. Gods, I am cold!~
@1808 = ~No, it is fine.~
@1809 = ~I would like to, but we may attract monsters. Your arms will have to do.~
@1810 = ~I seem to recall we had a bottle of Evermead somewhere, as well... no, it is empty. Very well, a fire it is.~
@1811 = ~I envy you. For me, the setting is unbearable. How is it that you are able to stay so cool and composed all the time?~
@1812 = ~It is my heritage, I suppose.~
@1813 = ~That is the type of person I am.~
@1814 = ~Because you are with me?~
@1815 = ~You are a strong woman, and a demigod. Yes, I suppose that explains it.~
@1816 = ~I must be going mad, but this place, this danger, make me cling to you tonight all the more. Instead of perusing my spellbook, I cannot take my eyes off you. A year has passed since we met, but you are no less beautiful... and no less desirable.~
@1817 = ~So are you.~
@1818 = ~At least one bit of good news tonight!~
@1819 = ~Here, of all places? Among mud and slime? No, thanks.~
@1820 = ~Indeed? I wonder if you change your mind in the morning... but I will do my best to make sure you do not.~
@1821 = ~(sigh) I did not doubt you would say so. But you are right, of course. Here, have my cloak... and rest well.~
@1822 = ~Please, do not tell me that you are hopelessly, throughly and disgustingly drunk.~ [O#XAN096]
@1823 = ~Wh-what? No, I am com-plete-ly sober! So there!~
@1824 = ~Er. Ah. Um, Xan, that's n-not what you th-think...~
@1825 = ~Really? Why, yes. Strrrrrange how this (hic!) bottle got so light all of a s-sudden.~
@1826 = ~Why, yesss! Wanna join?~
@1827 = ~Ah, yes. (sigh) Completely.~
@1828 = ~Indeed? And what should I think?~
@1829 = ~Because you devoured it alone, I presume.~
@1830 = ~Were you in a more coherent state, I would. But you can barely stand, and barely talk.~
@1831 = ~Why did you do it, may I ask?~
@1832 = ~N-no, you mayn't... may not. Leave me be.~
@1833 = ~(hic!) I'm a poor l-lonely Bhaalspawn. Nobody loves me, ev-everybody wants to kill me...~
@1834 = ~I am t-tired of this life! Ir-renicus, Bodhi, Imoen - too much for little ol' me. I want to forget. All of it.~
@1835 = ~Jus' to drink! Try some, it's fun!~
@1836 = ~I will not. You will rest now, or we shall be in deep trouble, to say the least. Drunk or not, you are going to bed.~
@1837 = ~Wh-what? You dare...~
@1838 = ~No way! (hic!) I am here, and I l-like it.~
@1839 = ~All right, I'm going.~
@1840 = ~Wait a m-minute! We've got a QUEST to perform! Yesss, q-quest!~
@1841 = ~Yes, <CHARNAME>, I dare, and I will dare more if you do not go quietly.~
@1842 = ~All right, then. L-let's go upstairs.~
@1843 = ~(hic!) Not in th-this lifetime!~
@1844 = ~Then, I'm afraid, I will have to carry you to your room rather unceremoniously...~
@1845 = ~I am relieved.~
@1846 = ~What quest do you have in mind? Killing yourself with your own weapon? Picking a fight? Falling down the stairs?~
@1847 = ~No, melamin, you are going to sleep.~
@1848 = ~You will be relieved of your worries very fast, should you continue in this manner. Look at yourself. (sigh) Either I take you upstairs, or you go on your own, but I would not want you to sit here and drink yourself to death.~
@1849 = ~I will! Leave me b-be!~
@1850 = ~As you wish. I d-don't care.~
@1851 = ~S-so, you'll not listen to my gr-gr-grievances? You are a mean, ev-vil person, you!~
@1852 = ~I will listen when you are able to talk. For now, melamin, you are going to sleep.~
@1853 = ~Good morning to you. Are you well?~ [O#XAN097]
@1854 = ~Ooooohhhh... my head...~
@1855 = ~Are you mad at me?~
@1856 = ~No thanks to you! Dragging me to bed last night!~
@1857 = ~(sigh) Come here. If you pass some of your pain to me through our bond, you will feel better. Here, now... that should help.~
@1858 = ~Thank you. Shall we go?~
@1859 = ~I would have your apology for dragging me off the other night, first.~
@1860 = ~No, but I am worried about you. I may not show it every time, but I care, and I do not want you to destroy yourself.~
@1861 = ~It is a custom among our people to indulge in wines and merriment, but now, when we have to watch every shadow, it is suicidal. Please, do not do this again.~
@1862 = ~Hmph. I'll think about it.~
@1863 = ~I will not. I am sorry, Xan.~
@1864 = ~If you promise not to interfere again, I will not.~
@1865 = ~Had I not done that, you would be lying on the pavement with your throat cut and your pockets emptied. I did not want to interfere, but your life means more to me than your dignity. Much more.~
@1866 = ~Will you forgive me?~
@1867 = ~Of course I will!~
@1868 = ~If you promise not to interfere again, I will.~
@1869 = ~(sigh) Let us go, then.~
@1870 = ~Should I stand idle when you are hit by a spell or an arrow? There is no difference between the two. But as you wish.~
@1871 = ~I wanted to enchant a ring for you, but this one overshadows everything I will ever be able to give you. How ironic that it comes from the Shadowmaster of Athkatla.~ [O#XAN098]
@1872 = ~It is not that good, really.~
@1873 = ~A ring? For me? Bring it on!~
@1874 = ~I do not think that Aran holds any feelings for me.~
@1875 = ~I would wear your ring even if there was no enchantment.~
@1876 = ~It is powerful enough to belong to royalty. Though, of course, you deserve better.~
@1877 = ~No, he does not. But the exact purpose of this gift leaves me guessing.~
@1878 = ~A mere bauble will not protect your life, and I have no time to enchant a ring properly. Perhaps in the future...~
@1879 = ~Strangely enough, it reminded me of the ring your half-brother presented to you at Candlekeep. Both of these are designed to protect, but the men who offered them sent you to death. Sarevok - to fight with Iron Throne leaders, Aran Linvail - to spar with the other guild. Is it an example of studied irony, true benevolence or twisted intent?~
@1880 = ~I have always thought that my destiny possessed a twisted sense of humor.~
@1881 = ~Aran needs a capable band of mercenaries, hence the ring and the amulet.~
@1882 = ~Perhaps Sarevok cared about me? Very deep down?~
@1883 = ~These are different cases. Sarevok played with me; Aran wants to help.~
@1884 = ~I have doubts about his intentions. Shadow Thieves are not known for their benevolence. What if he discards you? What if he refuses to secure passage? What if he betrays you? You are a Bhaalspawn; it is natural that you invoke mistrust.~
@1885 = ~Such is my destiny.~
@1886 = ~Mistrust? Do I invoke it in you, as well?~
@1887 = ~Perhaps, but I do not see what I can do to prevent this.~
@1888 = ~Do you have other suggestions?~
@1889 = ~It is shameful, but before meeting you, I believed the Bhaalspawn had no emotions at all, just hatred and blind ambition. But you feel, and you love. Perhaps... perhaps Sarevok was not a hopeless cause, either.~
@1890 = ~He is dead, so it is pointless to speculate now. But I wish more of your siblings were like you. Together, you would stand a chance against your destiny.~
@1891 = ~We are still rivals. Capable of love or not, we are destined to destroy each other.~
@1892 = ~You cannot cheat your destiny, Xan. It is impossible.~
@1893 = ~I might befriend some of my siblings. We shall see.~
@1894 = ~A magic word, your destiny. It is more powerful than any of my spells. Why do I get the feeling that it will be the death of me?~
@1895 = ~Because you are always expecting the worst?~
@1896 = ~Because 'doom' is your middle name?~
@1897 = ~It may happen. Everyone who travels with me is in danger.~
@1898 = ~I have no idea. Time will tell.~
@1899 = ~(sigh) Wait and see - ever the answer your destiny gives.~
@1900 = ~Indeed. (sigh) I am too happy now, with you. It cannot last.~
@1901 = ~No, but I urge you to be careful.~
@1902 = ~But it does us no good to linger here. The docks, he said?~
@1903 = ~Seldarine... What has he done to you?~ [O#XAN099]
@1904 = ~What has he done? Taken my spirit, that's what he has done!~
@1905 = ~I saw a dream... I was back at Candlekeep, and I fought a demon with Imoen's help. I survived, and returned into the real world, but Irenicus said that he succeeded... drained me of the only thing that made me special... my divinity.~
@1906 = ~I do not know... but I feel so cold...~
@1907 = ~Out of my way, Xan. I need to talk to Imoen.~
@1908 = ~Your spirit... your divinity...~
@1909 = ~Yes. Any suggestions?~
@1910 = ~Difficult to imagine, is it? Yes, I can hardly believe it, too.~
@1911 = ~Yes, and Irenicus will not get away with this! I'll kill him, for Imoen and myself!~
@1912 = ~I feel pity for him. Irenicus suffers greatly... he needs my spirit more than I.~
@1913 = ~Yes, and now I really need to talk to Imoen. It is urgent!~
@1914 = ~I am here, Estel'amin. It will be all right in a moment... but I need to know what he has done. Do you remember?~
@1915 = ~Yes. He has taken my spirit for himself.~
@1916 = ~Irenicus spoke of revenge... and he said I am dead on the inside. My spirit is gone.~
@1917 = ~How can I not remember? He drained me of my divinity! It is not easy to forget!~
@1918 = ~Of course. You are alive, and that's what's important.~
@1919 = ~I do not know what to say. I would suggest that you rest, but it will only hasten the inevitable. I would urge you to go forward, but Irenicus will invariably kill us all. I would give you my own spirit, but it is impossible. I would...~
@1920 = ~(sigh) Let us go. There is no point in lingering here.~
@1921 = ~My magic is at your disposal, if it is of any help. But now, more than ever, I understand how little it means.~
@1922 = ~You... you did not mean that, did you? <CHARNAME>, if you go mad in here, we are surely doomed.~
@1923 = ~Stop. You changed countenance yet again. What is going on?~ [O#XAN100]
@1924 = ~I feel strange. I nearly fainted downstairs; what will happen next?~
@1925 = ~Funny you should ask. My spirit is stolen, remember?~
@1926 = ~Irenicus is what's going on! I'll chop him into pieces and make him swallow his own spells, should I meet the bastard again!~
@1927 = ~Nothing. Get a spell ready, and let's move on.~
@1928 = ~I do not know, and I am scared for you.~
@1929 = ~I do not face the stealing of souls often, as you must know. Whatever is happening to you it is a mystery to me.~
@1930 = ~I know. And on the outside, you look strong enough to try.~
@1931 = ~To where, <CHARNAME>? How can I continue by your side and not know what is happening to you?~
@1932 = ~Your hands are steady, your performance in battle is supreme, but what of the real you within? Our bond is weakening, I barely feel you.~
@1933 = ~But perhaps... you are still alive, and the curse has no effect yet... perhaps Irenicus has taken only your taint? And now you are free, no longer a Bhaalspawn? And these effects are only... temporary?~
@1934 = ~I can hardly believe in Irenicus' benevolence.~
@1935 = ~I would like to think so, but it is too much to hope for.~
@1936 = ~He said: "It is the worst of curses, and I should know." There is no hope, Xan.~
@1937 = ~There is only one way to find out. Wait and see.~
@1938 = ~Neither do I, but he may have done so unknowingly. He was experimenting on you, as well as on your unfortunate sister. She was not herself for quite some time, but she recovered. As may you.~
@1939 = ~Hope? <CHARNAME>, you are my hope. While you hope, I breathe.~
@1940 = ~Yes... wait and see.~
@1941 = ~But if there is no hope for you, I'd rather die here and now, as there will be no point in moving further.~
@1942 = ~What could be worse than you turning into the avatar of Bhaal? Only entering the domain of the drow.~ [O#XAN101]
@1943 = ~It is so dark, and rumored to be so dangerous... I wish we were anywhere but here.~
@1944 = ~Really? I thought if we were to die, there would be no difference as to where.~
@1945 = ~I assure you, for me the former is much more important.~
@1946 = ~Typical. You are always thinking about yourself.~
@1947 = ~We will be. I am strangely confident of this, since now I know that your enemy is only human. My spells harmed him once, and will kill him next time, this I swear to you.~
@1948 = ~Does standing in an area inhabited by illithids, drow and duergar do nothing for your composure? My hands are trembling... But of course, you have more pressing matters to worry about.~
@1949 = ~The place itself does not mean more to me than your condition; I misspoke. But one influences another.~
@1950 = ~Estel'amin, my heart, how are you? Does it get worse?~
@1951 = ~A stupid question. Dying slowly isn't pleasant.~
@1952 = ~What should I say? "Hello, Xan, this is Slayer?" "Slayer, this is Xan?"~
@1953 = ~I feel normal, I guess. I hope that I will be able to hold on.~
@1954 = ~I'm just sick and tired of it all. I want to go home.~
@1955 = ~No, it is not, and I doubt that assuring you of my subsequent death would make you feel any better.~
@1956 = ~I should not have asked you this. Let us move on.~
@1957 = ~(shudder) It was completely uncalled for: the memory of *that* encounter burns in my memory brightly, I assure you. But since you retain your wit, I assume you are able to go on... for the time being.~
@1958 = ~Let us go, then, while you have strength. I wish I could hold your hand instead of clutching my bags of spell components, but, alas, it is the only way I can help you now.~
@1959 = ~Home... if only we had a home. But we have none. No home, no hope of starting a family, and no future, either.~
@1960 = ~But I do not regret it. Not in the least.~
@1961 = ~I wish I did not keep silent during our transformation, but I was so shocked that I could not say a word. To become a drow, to see you as a drow... Now we are truly doomed.~ [O#XAN102]
@1962 = ~Scared?~
@1963 = ~Adalon would not send us to certain death. We'll make it.~
@1964 = ~It shouldn't be so bad. Our disguise is safe enough.~
@1965 = ~Do you think it is too late to back out?~
@1966 = ~And our stay in this form will be very short, if we keep gaping at each other. Let's go!~
@1967 = ~Apprehensive, I admit. Aren't you?~
@1968 = ~Well, it cannot get any worse, can it?~
@1969 = ~I would run away immediately, but is there another way to track Irenicus?~
@1970 = ~I trust Adalon and her disguise.~
@1971 = ~Yes... it seems that even the walls are staring at me. Let us get away from here.~
@1972 = ~Our disguise is impenetrable, but our minds are not. I know little of the ways of the drow, and I suspect you know even less.~
@1973 = ~We have no other way out, so we must continue. But trying to survive in Ust Natha, of all places, is nothing short of pure folly. Especially in this... form.~
@1974 = ~Why, don't you like my beautiful white hair and ebony skin?~
@1975 = ~I think that you look tantalizing, actually.~
@1976 = ~It is disgusting, I fully agree. But it's not for long.~
@1977 = ~It suffocates me. I fear I will never look the same again.~
@1978 = ~No. I look at you, and I imagine a whip in your hands, or a spider by your side. I stopped to feel you a short while ago, and now even your physical form is different. I may as well be walking next to a stranger.~
@1979 = ~This form ceased to be beautiful centuries ago: too many dirty and disgusting things are associated with it. I realize that it is only an illusion, but it maddens me just the same.~
@1980 = ~Is it? I should hope so, but it is not to happen. We will be killed and buried in drow shape. Though I doubt that anyone will take the task of burying us; rather, they will feed our bodies to the spiders.~
@1981 = ~I wish I could close my eyes, touch your hand and tell myself that it is only an illusion. But I cannot. I see a drow, and I myself am an equal abomination.~
@1982 = ~Let us continue; we should. But how scared I am of this place...~
@1983 = ~Lead on, then.~
@1984 = ~Do not look at me like this. I cannot.~ [O#XAN103]
@1985 = ~You cannot touch me because I look like a drow, can you? Why?~
@1986 = ~Neither can I. When will we become ourselves again?~
@1987 = ~Cannot - what?~
@1988 = ~I wasn't looking at you at all. Your mad fantasies again, I assume. Good night.~
@1989 = ~You have answered it yourself. We both look unnatural, and for me, it feels unnatural. I cannot be kissing you, even if I believe there is a real you beneath the drow facade.~
@1990 = ~Never, I suppose. Or, if we will, I'll have only a few days to look at you before you die your final death, deprived of everything you are.~
@1991 = ~I am sorry. Good night, <CHARNAME>.~
@1992 = ~I cannot love you in this form. It is an illusion, but it seeps into my heart as strongly as the real transformation would.~
@1993 = ~Good night, <CHARNAME>.~
@1994 = ~I am sorry.~
@1995 = ~You shouldn't be; it is not your fault. Good night.~
@1996 = ~But I need your help... I need your love.~
@1997 = ~Just stay with me. Close your eyes, if you must... but do not leave me.~
@1998 = ~You are being cold and heartless, that's all I can say.~
@1999 = ~If I could, I would give it to you. I would give everything to you, but not this, not now. I cannot; do not ask me further.~
@2000 = ~I will not, of course. I will never leave you... never...~
@2001 = ~Will you have me loving you against my will?~
@2002 = ~No, of course not. But please, do not leave my side tonight.~
@2003 = ~No. I am sorry. Good night.~
@2004 = ~Foolish girl... You will regret it in the morning - if there is morning.~
@2005 = ~While the others are asleep, will you sit with me? There is something I need to ask you.~ [O#XAN104]
@2006 = ~I never liked this phrase.~
@2007 = ~Can it wait? Between Bodhi and the loss of my soul, there is a lot on my mind.~
@2008 = ~Make it quick, will you? I am tired.~
@2009 = ~No, but it is always necessary to make a preamble to an unpleasant talk, is it not?~
@2010 = ~It could wait until tomorrow, but will I be alive then? Will you?~
@2011 = ~I will not take much of your time.~
@2012 = ~You are slowly losing yourself. For a moment there, your eyes were empty, as if you were ready to turn into that... monstrosity again. We have a mortal battle with Bodhi ahead of us, a battle where you will need all your resources, but I beg of you, do not use this one. Do not employ the avatar of your sire, or the last shreds of you will melt away. You will melt away, Estel'amin. Do not use it... please...~
@2013 = ~Never fear, I will not.~
@2014 = ~That pathetic ability? No, I will not use it. My own strength is enough.~
@2015 = ~It is mine, and I will use it as I see fit.~
@2016 = ~This is good to hear. Come... I will not let you out of my arms until it is time for us to go and die.~
@2017 = ~Why would you doom yourself? You have a chance of survival, however meager it is. Why would you push it away?~
@2018 = ~I... you are right. I shouldn't.~
@2019 = ~Becoming a Slayer gives me power I otherwise would never have. I need it.~
@2020 = ~I have no choice. I need this strength to kill my enemies.~
@2021 = ~I am Murder, and I revel in it!~
@2022 = ~You have your own power, your own talent. You have me. You have allies who would aid you, should you require it. You do not need a dead god's withered husk.~
@2023 = ~You are right. I don't.~
@2024 = ~If I am able to protect you, I will, but I see it is futile. Good night, <CHARNAME>.~
@2025 = ~Do not rise. If you do, we will have to set out, kill, die... We are much better off here.~ [O#XAN105]
@2026 = ~We have to. A day, a month, and I will die without my spirit.~
@2027 = ~I am all for it.~
@2028 = ~It will be all right. Come, let us go.~
@2029 = ~So, you are not afraid to stay at the side of the Slayer?~
@2030 = ~I know. But will a few minutes change anything?~
@2031 = ~(sigh) Will a few minutes change anything?~
@2032 = ~We are one, <CHARNAME>. I cannot be afraid of myself. There is fear for you, but no fear of you. I have known you for too long a time.~
@2033 = ~I was watching you in your reverie, and it seemed impossible that some day, you will die. It is impossible that one so beautiful can die at all.~
@2034 = ~Am I beautiful to you? Even without my spirit?~
@2035 = ~It is a hollow beauty. Dead inside.~
@2036 = ~Thank you, but it is a false hope.~
@2037 = ~I will not. How can I? I am beautiful.~
@2038 = ~Not if I can help it. You will live. Irenicus and his sister have undoubtedly prepared their share of nasty surprises for us, but no barrier will stop you from regaining your spirit. You will win, and I will hold your hand all the way.~
@2039 = ~That would be nice.~
@2040 = ~I will manage myself, thank you.~
@2041 = ~Yes. Time to face these nasty surprises, don't you think?~
@2042 = ~You are. You are a living, breathing beauty, and you will not die.~
@2043 = ~I have no doubt you will. I doubt myself, but I shall never doubt you again.~
@2044 = ~I certainly hope so. Now, if no one has stolen my robes yet, I will be ready in a moment...~
@2045 = ~Athkatla again. After all the dangers we encountered, it seems almost... peaceful.~ [O#XAN106]
@2046 = ~Athkatla! Oh, I missed it!~
@2047 = ~I hate this noisy hole!~
@2048 = ~There is a small difference: when we departed it, I had my soul.~
@2049 = ~No time for this. We need supplies, and Bodhi awaits.~
@2050 = ~I imagined you would. We were happy here, though this happiness proved fleeting.~
@2051 = ~It is better than the Underdark, in any case. Besides, I see you again. The real, true and beautiful you.~
@2052 = ~You will regain your spirit, I swear. I lost hope in the Underdark, but here, to<DAYNIGHT>, under your gaze, I am slowly regaining it. You will live. No matter the cost.~
@2053 = ~I know, but now we really must go.~
@2054 = ~Strange: you are gaining hope, and I am losing it.~
@2055 = ~Of course I will win! I do not have a doubt!~
@2056 = ~To futility...~
@2057 = ~No. To victory.~
@2058 = ~It is easy to explain. Despite the loss of your spirit, you never looked better, while I am too tired to strike a heroic pose. I find you inspiring, but it is hardly mutual. Especially after my behavior in the Underdark...~
@2059 = ~I know. After the Underdark twists, you have every reason to be sure of yourself. And I feel ashamed.~
@2060 = ~I look back and see that I did not support you as I should. You needed love, and care, but you had none. I was too frightened to spare any, and too anxious to notice your need. Will you forgive me?~
@2061 = ~I will always forgive you.~
@2062 = ~I will, this time.~
@2063 = ~Do not blame yourself. You cared more than I expected you to.~
@2064 = ~It will be hard to do. You hurt me too much with your indifference.~
@2065 = ~I did not need your help, Xan. I survived on my own just fine.~
@2066 = ~Thank you. We may die tomorrow, but I will not think of it today. Not with you so near. But come: our doom awaits.~
@2067 = ~(sigh) I will try to live on hope that you will forgive me before we die, then. But come: our doom awaits.~
@2068 = ~It is good to know, even if it does not lessen my guilt. But it is of no importance: if you are well, nothing else should matter. Come: our doom awaits.~
@2069 = ~More and more often I am forcibly reminded that you are no mortal woman.~ [O#XAN107]
@2070 = ~A slowly dying woman, more like.~
@2071 = ~Reminded? Why, are you still closing your eyes to my heritage?~
@2072 = ~What triggered this?~
@2073 = ~Yes, I am partly immortal. Some day, people will pay tribute to me as their goddess.~
@2074 = ~We shall do our best to reach Irenicus before it happens... but yes, this is true, as well. I do not wish to turn you to the black memories, however. What I am concerned about is your future, should you survive.~
@2075 = ~I am trying my best. But it is not possible, as your divine lineage shows itself every day.~
@2076 = ~You have become powerful. The mighty ones of this world no longer treat you as a fetch and carry type, but rather, a force to be reckoned with. You have stepped into your sire's shoes, <CHARNAME>.~
@2077 = ~They might indeed. Your power grows, and with it grow my chances to be left behind.~
@2078 = ~You are an adventurer. You were forced to take this path in the beginning, but I do not see you continuing against your will. You want power, and eventually, your reckless desire to have it all will either get you killed or... or you will win. Your eyes will close one final time, and a new deity will enter the pantheon.~
@2079 = ~What will happen to me, if, by any insignificant chance, I survive? Our souls are interlocked within the Weave; when divinity affects it, they will make a fine mesh indeed. What will I be? A mortal with a touch of divinity? A Chosen of my beloved goddess?~
@2080 = ~What, like Elminster? No. A pointy hat is definitely out of the question.~
@2081 = ~Let us consider this when it happens. For now, it is impossible.~
@2082 = ~I do not know, but I am afraid you will die.~
@2083 = ~But we are one. Can't you ascend with me?~
@2084 = ~If you say so. Though this one is a lighter option, I suspect.~
@2085 = ~And I hope that it stays impossible, however selfish it sounds.~
@2086 = ~I very well may die, yes. But you will die, too, in a way. You will change. Not for better or worse - different.~
@2087 = ~You will hate me for this, but I shall tell you the truth: I would not, even if I could. I do not wish to give up everything I am. I want to retain my memories, my conscience... my love. I do not want to transcend this for an empty promise of power.~
@2088 = ~Self-delusion is sweet. But sooner or later, the bitter truth sinks in: you will leave me. I cannot pretend that I do not want to lock you up until the last but one of your siblings lies dead, and the last one - not you! - ascends. I do. But it is your choice. Your destiny.~
@2089 = ~And I fear that it will be fulfilled.~
@2090 = ~Why are you telling me this? I have no choice! This essence, this power is thrust upon me!~
@2091 = ~I would gladly be locked up, myself. A simple life is all I want, not divinity!~
@2092 = ~Let us get Irenicus, first. I cannot take your words seriously while he still lives.~
@2093 = ~So be it.~
@2094 = ~I do not know. There is no hope, that much is certain. But I keep hoping.~
@2095 = ~Then do not forget this. You may change, grow stronger, become tempted by circumstances and opportunities - but do not forget that here, in this day, you said these words.~
@2096 = ~Of course. (sigh) If only Irenicus was the one to take your destiny, and you were the one to live your life...~
@2097 = ~If you permit me to say, you are performing admirably. Given our current plight, I would not be surprised if you refused to pursue Irenicus and forgot all about Imoen.~ [O#XAN108]
@2098 = ~Irenicus and I have a lot to discuss, and I will not put the matter to rest.~
@2099 = ~I cannot abandon Imoen to this monster. I know that she would have done the same for me.~
@2100 = ~I am afraid to proceed, but I have to.~
@2101 = ~I have no desire to find them. My only goal is adventuring.~
@2102 = ~None of your business. Move on.~
@2103 = ~To discuss? It will be the shortest meeting in the history of Toril! Unless you want to save your companion, I would advise you to steer clear of him.~
@2104 = ~I can't. I need the power he spoke of.~
@2105 = ~He tortured me, and he will pay!~
@2106 = ~Perhaps. I still want to rescue Imoen, however.~
@2107 = ~You are right. He is not worth it, and neither is Imoen.~
@2108 = ~I barely remember the girl, but she seems a decent person to me. Do you worry about her? Or is she just a nameless damsel in distress to you?~
@2109 = ~How can I not worry, Xan? She is practically my sister!~
@2110 = ~She is my long-term companion. We are friends, too, I suppose.~
@2111 = ~I feel obliged to save her. Gorion would want me to.~
@2112 = ~I do not know why I bother, really. She stole my things, played cruel pranks on me - Imoen is a scamp, plain and simple.~
@2113 = ~I hate her. Everyone in Candlekeep liked her. Her, not me!~
@2114 = ~I understand. My own missions leave me with the same feeling, but I have to go on, regardless. It seems you are a kindred spirit.~
@2115 = ~I wonder, who is your primary goal? Imoen or Irenicus?~
@2116 = ~Imoen. I care about her.~
@2117 = ~Irenicus. We have a lot to discuss.~
@2118 = ~Both, I suppose.~
@2119 = ~Why do you ask?~
@2120 = ~You may soon change your mind. The wizard is powerful, your friend is helpless - I do not believe you will abandon her so easily. Though, on the first glance, it seems to be the safest thing to do.~
@2121 = ~Ah, so fifteen thousand gold were given to a shadowy organization, because you felt it did not agree with adventuring. Very interesting.~
@2122 = ~Oh, I shall.~
@2123 = ~Power? Tell me, have you ever heard of power given for free and freely?~
@2124 = ~No, I haven't.~
@2125 = ~Numerous times. Elminster, other Mystra's Chosen, me and my siblings...~
@2126 = ~I will *make* Irenicus give me power.~
@2127 = ~Revenge? It is pointless. You killed Gorion's murderer, but did it make you rest easier?~
@2128 = ~Of course. Justice has been done.~
@2129 = ~No, it didn't. Gorion remains dead.~
@2130 = ~No, I think not. I often wonder what could have been if Sarevok had not given in to Bhaal's promises.~
@2131 = ~It will be a hard blow, then, if you arrive and find her dead. But it may happen, and you must be ready for this turn of events.~
@2132 = ~You face a difficult decision, then. Between her safety and yours, I choose yours without a thought, but the final word belongs to you.~
@2133 = ~Gorion would, judging by your stories of him, and I am sure that you will not disappoint his memory. But be careful.~
@2134 = ~I am sorry to hear this. On my part, I reassure you that I have never been prone to such behavior, so for the time being, you are as safe from these assaults as one can be.~
@2135 = ~But you are not in Candlekeep, and I assure you, not everyone appreciates her more than you. Those days are behind you, but for her, the torment only begins.~
@2136 = ~I see. I do not wish to discuss Irenicus, since the very thought chills me, but I wonder how you feel about Imoen.~
@2137 = ~It may sound portentous, but I care about your fate. It matters to me whether you wish to save your friend, or to chase a powerful enemy. The former is simply dangerous. The latter is a conscious death wish.~
@2138 = ~Then I must have a death wish, for Irenicus it is. We have a lot to discuss.~
@2139 = ~It is dangerous, but I have to get to Imoen.~
@2140 = ~I want to reach both of them.~
@2141 = ~You have not, because it never happens. Continue wishing for Irenicus' power, and you are truly doomed.~
@2142 = ~Elminster pays by not interfering: he walks the Realms, and yet he does not live. Other Chosen have to accept responsibilities heavier and greater than you imagine, and you... you have to pay with your beautiful soul.~
@2143 = ~(sigh) Do you ever listen to reason, I wonder?~
@2144 = ~Both your foster father and your half-brother are dead, and you are only thinking of justice? I wish I had your resolve.~
@2145 = ~And this is exactly why I think that blind, bloodthirsty revenge is pointless.~
@2146 = ~Do not make decisions rashly, whatever you do. Your life, mine, Imoen's, your other companions' - they hang by a thread which will strengthen or snap, depending on your choice. Do not make it a wrong one.~
@2147 = ~But which is the right one?~
@2148 = ~I will try.~
@2149 = ~Xan, keep your advice to yourself.~
@2150 = ~This, <CHARNAME>, is for you to decide.~
@2151 = ~You are a talented leader. For what it is worth, I believe in you.~
@2152 = ~I had feared Irenicus' treatment of you would stretch as far as to scar your face. It is fortunate that I was mistaken.~ [O#XAN109]
@2153 = ~I know I am fortunate! It is my face, after all.~
@2154 = ~That's because I am an elf. We heal fast, don't we?~
@2155 = ~Oh, wonderful! Irenicus, pain, scars - shall we discuss torture in detail next?~
@2156 = ~Trust me, I really do not want to talk about it.~
@2157 = ~And, as any elven face, it is beautiful. I recall a wizard - Tolgerias, his name was - telling me there were scars on Imoen's face and hands when the girl was brought to a short trial. I was afraid you would share her fate.~
@2158 = ~There are scars and scars. Your captor was so powerful that he made the city shatter, yet he wore a mask. Not all ailments can be cured, even by the powerful ones of this world. And the madman wanted to hurt you as much as possible, it seems.~
@2159 = ~I know I should not have said that, but it seemed so unfair that one so young would be scarred for life that I could not help myself.~
@2160 = ~It was tactless of me, of course. My apologies. Still, I am glad: no one should be so irreverent as to deface your beauty.~
@2161 = ~It is monstrous, and un-elven, to taint beauty. I have rarely wanted to kill someone, but now I cannot help the desire, even if it is an impossible one. Given his power, I'll be dead within seconds.~
@2162 = ~Regardless, it is nice to hear. Thank you.~
@2163 = ~Let us see who kills who, shall we?~
@2164 = ~That's enough melodrama for now, Xan.~
@2165 = ~You are very welcome. Who knows, you may be the last of my people I am traveling with.~
@2166 = ~Why? Won't you return to Evereska?~
@2167 = ~Of course, of course. You are doomed, and I will have the honor to bury your cold and dead body.~
@2168 = ~I hope not.~
@2169 = ~I would rather you stopped nurturing this hope. With an adversary like yours, we all shall be dead before long.~
@2170 = ~Of course, of course. We are all doomed.~
@2171 = ~You may return to Evereska, if you are so scared.~
@2172 = ~Melo... ah. I see. I will keep it to myself from now on.~
@2173 = ~I will not. Not until my mission is fulfilled, in any case. You are the only link with my people I have.~
@2174 = ~Why do you treat these matters so lightly? You buried Gorion; Khalid and Dynaheir died practically before your eyes. Your mother is likely dead, too. Do not jest with death, <CHARNAME>.~
@2175 = ~So do I... and doubly so since I met you for the second time. Whether it was my good luck or my ill fortune, remains to be seen.~
@2176 = ~What went wrong? Do you remember?~ [O#XAN110]
@2177 = ~What are you talking about?~
@2178 = ~I remember everything! Just ask me, and you shall see!~
@2179 = ~Not that I do. Irenicus, travel, fight - you know how it goes.~
@2180 = ~We've no time for reminiscing, Xan.~
@2181 = ~We traveled together before, when your heritage was yet unknown. I was attracted to you somewhat, as you well know. But at some moment, everything went wrong. What happened?~
@2182 = ~Gorion's letter, telling me who my sire was. You were so shocked that you barely talked to me ever since.~
@2183 = ~We traveled together only for a short while. There was no time to form a relationship.~
@2184 = ~I remember being rude to you once or twice.~
@2185 = ~I had another suitor, as you probably remember.~
@2186 = ~Now I doubt whether I should. (sigh) But I will.~
@2187 = ~You suffered much more than one so young should... and I added to it, it seems.~
@2188 = ~No time at all? Even for... oh, but never mind. I should not have raised the subject.~
@2189 = ~Yes, it is hard to be enamoured of a doomed woman. Though you are no less beautiful than back then... and again, in no small danger.~
@2190 = ~No, of course not. Between bounty hunters, Gorion's murder and other dangers of adventuring, a small and fragile feeling could and did get lost easily.~
@2191 = ~Oh, you certainly were. Have you changed since then, I wonder?~
@2192 = ~Scores of suitors, more likely. And I believe it has not changed.~
@2193 = ~Perhaps it is for the best.~
@2194 = ~Still, I find myself buried in wishful thinking. "What if...", and my musings continue endlessly. One of these days, I shall simply forget to memorize my spells.~
@2195 = ~Please, don't. I prefer a capable wizard to a daydreamer.~
@2196 = ~"What if?" I wonder myself.~
@2197 = ~I can reassure you right now. The answer is: "No way!"~
@2198 = ~Could we start again? Please?~
@2199 = ~Of course... I would not want to endanger your safety.~
@2200 = ~Besides, it is pointless.~
@2201 = ~Nothing good would have come of it, in any case. Should it have come to pass, Irenicus would have only gloated a little longer before killing me instead of the unfortunate Khalid.~
@2202 = ~Ah. Thank you, <CHARNAME>.~
@2203 = ~What is the point? Do you like to play with fire? We shall die regardless, why make it more painful? No, it is pointless.~
@2204 = ~The land we travel is a strange one. Prejudice upon prejudice - and its citizens excel in coming up with the new ones each day.~ [O#XAN111]
@2205 = ~Do you mean their unceasing feuds and power struggle? They are humans; it should be expected of them.~
@2206 = ~Do you mean the way they treat elves? It is understandable, for Tethyr is close by.~
@2207 = ~Do you mean the way they treat women? Calimshite tendencies tend to spread, I agree.~
@2208 = ~Do you mean the prejudice against magic users? Yes, the license fee is enormous.~
@2209 = ~I have not noticed any.~
@2210 = ~Prejudice can be a good thing.~
@2211 = ~I would not say that Evereska is free of it. But here, in Amn, it takes ridiculously overblown forms. The names of the rulers are unknown, and yet assassinations flourish. Shadow Thieves work out in the open, and craftsmen worry about competition more than about their artwork's quality. And, of course, there is slavery.~
@2212 = ~But we are opposing it. Wherever I can, I fight thugs and confront corrupted officials.~
@2213 = ~Why should I care?~
@2214 = ~And that is how life should be! Humans have the right idea!~
@2215 = ~Tethyr is a special case. The last three human kings sanctioned the slaughter of our kin, and this bloody page shall not be forgotten soon. But Amn and Tethyr never got on well, so Amnish citizens did not inherit any special dislike towards elves. There are madmen and deranged drunks, but I would not pay attention to them.~
@2216 = ~I have seen enough to think otherwise.~
@2217 = ~But perhaps it is our fault? Our arrogance may be the reason humans do not accept elves.~
@2218 = ~What do you mean by prejudice, then?~
@2219 = ~They do, I'm afraid. Some of the examples are truly despicable. To my knowledge, there are no extreme cases, such as unwilling elven concubines sold in slavery to Calimport, but forced marriages flourish here, as well as lifetime imprisonment for female infidelity. I doubt it will change anytime soon.~
@2220 = ~If only I knew where the Council of Six was hiding, I would give them all a good thrashing!~
@2221 = ~It is a pity.~
@2222 = ~I do not care. These are their lives to waste.~
@2223 = ~A liar and a cheat deserves no better, in my opinion.~
@2224 = ~Strangely, this prejudice saved your life. If not for the Cowled Wizards, I would not be talking to you now. But allowing only the greediest to use magic does nothing for the atmosphere in Athkatla. License or not, I feel strangely helpless there. Do you?~
@2225 = ~No, I am fine. Athkatla is a big, interesting city. The Cowled Wizards will not spoil the pleasure for me.~
@2226 = ~I do. It is frightening when one organization has that much control.~
@2227 = ~I do not care about the Cowled Wizards one way or another.~
@2228 = ~I am not helpless. Far from it. I will overwhelm them, yet.~
@2229 = ~That was because you did not look closely. In Amn, slavery is illegal as of now, but the River Road out of Athkatla is often used for transporting unwilling passengers in and out of the city, together with banned goods. Your friend was abducted by the Cowled Wizards for the use of a single spell, is it not a prejudice to you?~
@2230 = ~Is it? A prejudice against an orc who approaches you with a huge axe and a battle cry is a good thing, perhaps. But against anyone and everyone enslaved? Every foreign magic user? I beg to disagree.~
@2231 = ~It is pointless. You will be gone - or dead - within a year. But I commend your efforts.~
@2232 = ~It is disgusting to enslave a sentient being. What if you yourself became a slave? It is not a pleasant experience, I assure you.~
@2233 = ~Disgusting? From you, an enchanter, it is strange to hear.~
@2234 = ~No, I guess it is not.~
@2235 = ~Nonsense. I will never become a slave.~
@2236 = ~I would not use my art other than to defend myself. Charming someone is a process that hurts both sides, and these days, I am using it more for your sake than mine.~
@2237 = ~You had been a prisoner three times already - in Candlekeep, the Flaming Fist quarters, and Irenicus' lair. A prisoner is only one step away from a slave.~
@2238 = ~I hope you will not meet with it again. I will shield you from it, if I can, but should we travel to Tethyr or further south, it may become impossible.~
@2239 = ~What do you call arrogance? The desire to shield forests from axes and fire? Some reluctance to form friendships with beings that are painfully mortal? Difficulties in understanding those who are not a part of the Spirit? <CHARNAME>, we are not arrogant, we are different. The time will come, and you will understand it.~
@2240 = ~There are many, but the one that concerns me the most is the strict ban on magic, and the fact that magic users are particularly shunned.~
@2241 = ~Thankfully, you will not find them.~
@2242 = ~Indeed, it is not easy to witness.~
@2243 = ~I suppose you are right. Still, it is not easy to witness.~
@2244 = ~A rather unusual position, if harsh. But I have nothing to say to this. Judge as you will; your words have no power, regardless.~
@2245 = ~Alas, they have already done so for your companion. But if it does not detract you from enjoying the city, I am glad. Had something happened to you, I doubt I would have been so calm and composed.~
@2246 = ~And even more frightening when this organization holds a friend you are bound to rescue, or an enemy you are driven to kill. I fully share your sentiment.~
@2247 = ~But they care about you. Or they will, once you enter their domain to reach Imoen and Irenicus. And then... then you are doomed.~
@2248 = ~It is a doomed endeavour. The Cowled Wizards are too well protected, and in their own domain they are nigh invincible.~
@2249 = ~I wish we had met under better circumstances. But for the second time, we are forced to continue among slavers, insolence and abuse. Is it your destiny or my bad luck?~
@2250 = ~What destiny can a Bhaalspawn have? My every step is prophesied!~
@2251 = ~Your bad luck, I guess.~
@2252 = ~Ah, but it is the proof that we are not meant to travel together! Weep in despair, Xan, for the Fates themselves are against us!~
@2253 = ~(sigh) As flattering as it is to be the companion of the Chosen One, I wish with all my heart that you were not.~
@2254 = ~Then we are doomed indeed.~
@2255 = ~You are not serious, I presume?~
@2256 = ~No, of course not. What power could the Fates hold over me, the Chosen One?~
@2257 = ~As serious as ever.~
@2258 = ~I see. I am sorry. Perhaps I should leave... but regardless, I shall try to steer clear of you for the time being.~
@2259 = ~We talked about unfairness in Athkatla the other day. But what of the distortions in your life? What hurts you the most?~ [O#XAN112]
@2260 = ~Being what I am hurts me the most. Being a Spawn of Bhaal.~
@2261 = ~I am shunned, hunted, alone. There is nothing pleasant about it.~
@2262 = ~All who attach themselves to me, die.~
@2263 = ~All of it, I think. My heritage, death all around me, my unknown future...~
@2264 = ~Nothing. I am an adventurer, young, beautiful and powerful. Why would anything hurt me?~
@2265 = ~How foolish of me. It all comes down to your heritage, does it not? Every inequity you experienced, every death you witnessed originates from Bhaal being your sire.~
@2266 = ~Why? <CHARNAME>, I do not believe that you are made of stone. People die around you, and your friends die, as well. Is this all a game to you?~
@2267 = ~No, but unlike you, I see good in this life.~
@2268 = ~What should I do? Lie on the ground and wail about my grievous fate?~
@2269 = ~What is the point of not giving up? You are alone; you have no one else. You are considered dangerous by the just and unjust alike. Why do you go on?~
@2270 = ~I am not alone. I have faithful companions. You, for example.~
@2271 = ~Alone? Why, I am not alone. There is someone else who fancies me.~
@2272 = ~All alone, I am all alone...~
@2273 = ~Yes, I am alone. So what?~
@2274 = ~How can one so powerful be so naive?~
@2275 = ~Oh. My apologies for intruding, then.~
@2276 = ~Thank you for your understanding.~
@2277 = ~No, no, I did not mean anything! Please, continue.~
@2278 = ~You are not, mellonamin... my friend.~
@2279 = ~You will not survive alone. You will be full of vigor in the morning, but in the evening, you will stare at the empty campfire and think of death. It will come to be, I know.~
@2280 = ~You have me. I would like you to meet others of our race, but they may not accept you as one of us, since sooner or later, the truth about your heritage will come out, and we are rather prejudiced against Bhaal and his offspring.~
@2281 = ~But this is a stupid prejudice! I am an elf, just like you or any other!~
@2282 = ~That does not concern me. I can survive without their 'acceptance'.~
@2283 = ~Do you accept me as a fellow elf, then?~
@2284 = ~I know, and it hurts a great deal.~
@2285 = ~But I still have you. Thank you, Xan.~
@2286 = ~My pleasure.~
@2287 = ~Are you?~
@2288 = ~You have been away from the community too long. No, <CHARNAME>, you cannot.~
@2289 = ~I... I will not lie. Sometimes, I do not.~
@2290 = ~I am sorry. I wish I could help, but since the curse is solely yours, it is impossible.~
@2291 = ~We are an immortal race, but the immortality you carry within is frightening. Our minds aspire after spiritual communion, but yours is freezing alone. We have a close connection to nature, but yours is to death and murder. Our unions are those of trust and understanding, but you have grown among humans and their strange and twisted ideas of marriage... oh, but I am rambling. I am sorry. If you wish, I will tell you about it another time.~
@2292 = ~I shall be waiting eagerly.~
@2293 = ~You may, but I am hardly interested.~
@2294 = ~All right. Let us move on.~
@2295 = ~Why should I care? They will never accept me.~
@2296 = ~As will I.~
@2297 = ~Yes, let us move on.~
@2298 = ~It shall be as you say, of course.~
@2299 = ~No, you do not understand...~
@2300 = ~It never hurts to know more of your brethren. Who knows, perhaps it will help you become one of us in full, one day. And then...~
@2301 = ~N-never mind. I have been daydreaming again, it seems.~
@2302 = ~I promised to tell you about elven union. Are you ready to listen?~ [O#XAN113]
@2303 = ~Certainly, I am interested.~
@2304 = ~I'd rather not.~
@2305 = ~Not really, but I am bored. So go ahead.~
@2306 = ~It shall be as you say. I wonder, why do I keep chasing you at all?~
@2307 = ~It is curious: our vows tie mind, heart and spirit, but in an elven union, one's freedom has no restrictions. A bond unites the two, a connection which allows one to feel the needs and concerns of the other even from a great distance, but the couples may part for years of time, and neither intervenes in the other's affairs. To a human, it would be unimaginable.~
@2308 = ~It is strange to me, too. It sounds so cold.~
@2309 = ~It seems an ideal union to me.~
@2310 = ~But isn't it too intimate? I would not like anyone to read my thoughts.~
@2311 = ~No intervention, you say? But what if one of them is going to do something rash and risky?~
@2312 = ~For years of time? But what of adultery?~
@2313 = ~(sigh) And right you are. There is no point in musing on something you will never experience.~
@2314 = ~Cold? Have you been reading some epic tale or another? 'They' do not live happily 'ever after'. They die. Or worse, get tired of each other. Spending centuries together is no easy feat; centuries in full union are rarer still. Very few choose this path, but only they can be called truly in love.~
@2315 = ~Would you consider bonding with somebody?~
@2316 = ~I would never enter this path, myself.~
@2317 = ~It sounds strangely appropriate. I want to love and be loved this way.~
@2318 = ~Indeed. But bonding is still rare and unconventional. We live for centuries, and the afterlife in Arvandor stretches for all eternity. It takes a devoted soul to bond to one person, and certainly not to one of your heritage. You will never enter Arvandor; it is doubtful you will survive tomorrow.~
@2319 = ~Everyone deserves love, Xan. Regardless of who their sire was.~
@2320 = ~It does not happen. But feelings - joy, anxiety, grief - are easy to read. At least, I suppose so.~
@2321 = ~If they are sane and mature, nobody intervenes. A lover may warn their partner, but to stop them from performing the act? Doing so would mean considering them beneath you. And then... would it be love?~
@2322 = ~It depends on the couple in question.~
@2323 = ~But what about you?~
@2324 = ~I never... I do not know, <CHARNAME>. I never considered it. But I am used to putting duty over personal gain. Do you?~
@2325 = ~I would never betray the one I love.~
@2326 = ~The more I love, the better!~
@2327 = ~I do not know, either.~
@2328 = ~What do you think of it?~
@2329 = ~It is cold, uncaring, and distant.~
@2330 = ~It is a splendid union.~
@2331 = ~I do not care.~
@2332 = ~No... but what if you came to love another? But never mind.~
@2333 = ~Better for them, surely. But what of the one you will leave behind? Oh, but never mind.~
@2334 = ~The best way to find out would be to try, but it is pointless to break someone's heart only to know your own better. Unless... but it will not happen, I am sure. Let us go.~
@2335 = ~What for? To die earlier? To experience pain beyond measure when the loved one is gone? No.~
@2336 = ~I doubt you will be able to. It is difficult to love you. Half a woman, half a goddess - men will worship you, but to get close to you, to wake up with you every morning?~
@2337 = ~It is difficult to love you. Half a woman, half a goddess - men will worship you, but to get close to you, to wake up with you every morning?~
@2338 = ~I never argued that. But it is difficult to love you. Half a woman, half a goddess - men will worship you, but to get close to you, to wake up with you every morning?~
@2339 = ~I... I am sorry, <CHARNAME>. It was... inappropriate of me. Let us go.~
@2340 = ~How do you view failure?~ [O#XAN114]
@2341 = ~I will not fail, and I expect the same of others.~
@2342 = ~Mistakes happen. I am not invincible, myself.~
@2343 = ~With pity, but without sympathy.~
@2344 = ~I am a failure. My whole life is.~
@2345 = ~It is not a failure. You had no control over circumstances.~
@2346 = ~Not everyone is made of stone. I do not believe you are, even. How many times have you lost battles? How many times have you lost friends? Have you never cried in the night, never tried to forget a painful memory? You are a mortal woman, not a statue of living steel.~
@2347 = ~No, I suppose I am not.~
@2348 = ~To survive, sometimes you have to become a statue.~
@2349 = ~I never lose. I never cry. I never regret a single moment.~
@2350 = ~Everyone has their dark moments. So do I... and I would seek your advice, if you would help me. Would you?~
@2351 = ~Of course, Xan. I am listening.~
@2352 = ~I do not want to offend, but I've had more than enough of handling everybody's problems.~
@2353 = ~Please, no! Another soul-searching session would drive me mad.~
@2354 = ~You, <CHARNAME>? Why?~
@2355 = ~I failed Gorion, and now I failed Imoen.~
@2356 = ~Day after day, I fail to control the murder within.~
@2357 = ~I failed to protect myself and my friends from Irenicus.~
@2358 = ~I simply do not have the strength to go on.~
@2359 = ~Your enemies should see you like this, I do not doubt. But you have no need to wear an iron mask with me. It does not become you.~
@2360 = ~But you do go on. You curse, you sigh, you do it against your will - but you continue.~
@2361 = ~What would you do if you ceased having a hold over your emotions? If you stopped being in control of your choices? If your every step was no longer logical? If you failed to be indifferent?~
@2362 = ~I would stop, take a deep breath and regain control of my senses.~
@2363 = ~I would flow with the current. It might be pleasant for a change.~
@2364 = ~What you describe sounds suspiciously like falling in love.~
@2365 = ~What are you talking about? I do not understand.~
@2366 = ~I more than understand. Endless whining, soul-searching, consoling... and I am just such a person. (sigh) I will try to keep it to myself, if I can.~
@2367 = ~I tried, but it does not help. I am a failure, <CHARNAME>, an utter and complete failure.~
@2368 = ~It is disastrous. I will doom myself, and I will doom you. How do you expect me to perform in battle, if my mind is elsewhere?~
@2369 = ~Sometimes your astuteness is disconcerting. (sigh) I wish I could strike a heroic pose and proclaim: "Nothing of the sort!" Alas, I cannot.~
@2370 = ~Then it is best that you do not. It is not a feeling I would want you to share.~
@2371 = ~A mage unable to keep his emotions in check is a failure. I fear that soon, I will become useless to you.~
@2372 = ~The more I look into the sky, the more I see the imperfections of this world.~ [O#XAN115]
@2373 = ~Why? What is wrong with it?~
@2374 = ~I think it is perfect.~
@2375 = ~Tell it to someone who cares.~
@2376 = ~Look at the planets. Large spheres, forever alone in the darkness. The stars emanate heat, but we only see a faint light. The sun is bright, shining and beautiful, but after a while it will explode and disappear. I see this, and I want to fall to the ground and die.~
@2377 = ~It is not that bad.~
@2378 = ~We are alone. So are planets and stars.~
@2379 = ~The stars are apart, but we are not solitary. Look around you, and you will find consolation.~
@2380 = ~You may think so, but I see bright constellations, forms and shapes. There is no loneliness in the skies, just as there is none here.~
@2381 = ~What is the point? If you do not want to listen, nobody will. But I will not bother you again, if you so desire.~
@2382 = ~You say so, but I do not believe it. There is no hope anywhere. If the stars are doomed to burn out, what may we expect? Nothing. We will die, and will be forgotten.~
@2383 = ~It depends on you whether to be forgotten or not.~
@2384 = ~I am tired of your moaning. Talk to someone else!~
@2385 = ~Indeed we are. Will it ever change, I wonder?~
@2386 = ~I do not think so.~
@2387 = ~It might, if you try hard enough.~
@2388 = ~Do you want it to change?~
@2389 = ~I do not think I need a respite from loneliness. I want to, but when I think of the pain it will cause afterwards, I would rather not. It ends in death. Always, and I am afraid of it. Are you?~
@2390 = ~No, I am not. Life and love matter much more than death.~
@2391 = ~I do not worry about what the future will bring. The present is what matters.~
@2392 = ~I'm afraid, too.~
@2393 = ~<CHARNAME>, I am not a hero whose deeds are sung by bards all across the Realms, and neither do I want to be one. But it stings to die and to leave nothing behind me. There will be no pain when I die, but there will be no love, either. I do not want this.~
@2394 = ~Neither do I. But we are adventurers. We cannot expect a normal life.~
@2395 = ~There is love around, if you know where to look.~
@2396 = ~Then do not live like there's no tomorrow! Find love, start a family, but stop moaning!~
@2397 = ~No, I think not. But sometimes... sometimes I think it is possible. Another pointless hope.~
@2398 = ~But enough soul-searching for to<DAYNIGHT>, I suppose.~
@2399 = ~When you say this, your voice and your eyes make me believe it does. But it doesn't. Death is ultimate, and love is temporary.~
@2400 = ~But I know what the future will bring, and I do not like it in the least. I know that you will die, and nothing I do will stop it.~
@2401 = ~I know that my own future is far from peaceful. I know... but enough soul-searching for to<DAYNIGHT>, I suppose.~
@2402 = ~(sigh) A fine pair we are.~
@2403 = ~So beautiful, yet so dangerous. Now, what does that remind me of?~ [O#XAN116]
@2404 = ~What - or who?~
@2405 = ~Me?~
@2406 = ~I do not know. What?~
@2407 = ~What are you looking at?~
@2408 = ~My blade. But I was thinking of another.~
@2409 = ~As if you did not know...~
@2410 = ~Of course. Who else could it be?~
@2411 = ~It reminds me of you. More and more things do, to be honest. I suspected that I did not get rid of this suicidal infatuation in Baldur's Gate, but now I know for certain.~
@2412 = ~I knew it! You are in love with me!~
@2413 = ~"Suicidal infatuation?" Why, thank you very much, Xan.~
@2414 = ~My condolences. What are you going to do?~
@2415 = ~I am sorry, but I cannot return the sentiment.~
@2416 = ~I am... not... <CHARNAME>, does it matter? What matters is what you are, and in how much danger we may be.~
@2417 = ~Yes, my infatuation with you is ridiculous. You are a dangerous woman to travel with, let alone to care about. I doubted it before, but poor Khalid's and Dynaheir's fates proved it to me well enough. You are one of Bhaal's progeny, a manifestation of murder, a symbol of ultimate destruction. Mine.~
@2418 = ~Care... love... romance... (sigh) Let us move on and forget about this.~
@2419 = ~It is a good idea.~
@2420 = ~But I like you. You are more than just a traveling companion to me.~
@2421 = ~You are a foolish man, Xan, and you are making a foolish choice!~
@2422 = ~Yes, what is the point? I do not love you, anyway.~
@2423 = ~No. Please, don't.~
@2424 = ~It depends on you. Since you need my help, I will not leave you, unless you ask me to leave - or, rather, until I die. But as for my feelings...~
@2425 = ~I would have been shocked if you did, but then again, you are wiser than I am. Perhaps I will live to be cured of it, yet.~
@2426 = ~Exactly. Perhaps I will live to be cured of the feeling, yet.~
@2427 = ~I am afraid, <CHARNAME>. Irenicus; your taint; the forthcoming chase - we will regret this, don't you understand? You delude yourself if you think this will be over, people will stop dying around you, and your taint will never manifest itself. The best we can do is to delay the moment when death or destiny forces us to part.~
@2428 = ~But I bend to your will.~
@2429 = ~I do not see any other. I wish I had done it earlier... it would be less painful.~
@2430 = ~I hate to ask you this, but I need to know. Is there someone else?~ [O#XAN117]
@2431 = ~Yes, there is.~
@2432 = ~No, there is no one.~
@2433 = ~I am not going to tell you.~
@2434 = ~Why would you want to know?~
@2435 = ~I see. I wish you much happiness, <CHARNAME>.~
@2436 = ~No, you misunderstand. I have other admirers, but I am not in love with them.~
@2437 = ~It is a relief. I feared my dream was just what it was - a dream. Thank you for reassuring me.~
@2438 = ~Thank you for asking me.~
@2439 = ~Do you care for me, then?~
@2440 = ~Xan, I am sorry, but I do not have any feelings for you.~
@2441 = ~What? I am not reassuring you! You are nothing to me!~
@2442 = ~Are you sure? I will not bother you again, if you are, but if you are not, tell me.~
@2443 = ~All right. Yes, there is someone.~
@2444 = ~If you insist - no, there is no one.~
@2445 = ~I am sure. You do not need to know.~
@2446 = ~Because I have gone mad all of a sudden, why else? I do not want to hurt you with a hasty confession, if there is someone else in your heart.~
@2447 = ~Then I am sorry I asked.~
@2448 = ~Yes... I hope you will find it.~
@2449 = ~I cared for you from the first hour. But whether I have done the right thing in telling you, remains to be seen. Even now I believe it is pointless.~
@2450 = ~But... <CHARNAME>, if there truly is someone else who feels affection for you as I do, tell them how you feel. Otherwise, it would be cruel and unfair to all of us.~
@2451 = ~You are beautiful. Simple, banal words, but true, nevertheless.~ [O#XAN118]
@2452 = ~I know.~
@2453 = ~Why would you tell me this now?~
@2454 = ~Is this a confession?~
@2455 = ~No, thank you for allowing me to say this. But you will like my next words somewhat less, I'm afraid.~
@2456 = ~But the smile on your face - or is it a scowl? - is worth reminding you from time to time. But you will like my next words somewhat less, I'm afraid.~
@2457 = ~Because... I... (sigh)~
@2458 = ~Of a sort. But you will like my next words somewhat less, I'm afraid.~
@2459 = ~You are more than a friend and kin to me. I am attached to you, I cherish every day spent with you, and I do not wish it to end. But in the haze of the past days, I forgot where we were. We are hunting a monster, and within you, an even worse evil is hiding. I am at a loss of what to do.~
@2460 = ~To be with me as you should.~
@2461 = ~My heritage does not control me, Xan. I do.~
@2462 = ~Yes, I am a Bhaalspawn, and I want my power! What is wrong with this?~
@2463 = ~Will you abandon me now?~
@2464 = ~It is love you are seeking, but it is murder for which you were made. I want you to come to me, but so does Bhaal. And I have no doubt as to who will win.~
@2465 = ~It is an illusion. Your sire doomed you from the start. You think that you have tamed the beast, but it sleeps within. One day, it will wake, and then there will be no place for me in your life. Nor for you in mine.~
@2466 = ~Nothing, were it your own power. But deities are not known to share their power willingly, especially those who foresaw their own death. Bhaal's will shall twist you beyond recognition, and there will be no place for me in your life. Nor for you in mine.~
@2467 = ~I would like to reassure you and to say that it will never happen. But I cannot promise you this. Perhaps the future will bring an answer, but I doubt it will satisfy.~
@2468 = ~It is a strange feeling, not to be alone in this world.~ [O#XAN119]
@2469 = ~A wonderful feeling.~
@2470 = ~A frightening feeling.~
@2471 = ~A disconcerting feeling.~
@2472 = ~Were you alone before you met me?~
@2473 = ~It is, but it is unsettling rather than thrilling.~
@2474 = ~Frightening? No, I think not. I am scared for you, but I felt the same before.~
@2475 = ~Exactly. You are reading my thoughts.~
@2476 = ~Not all alone, no. Some of my family still live, and my parents, while dead, lived a long and full life. But I would rather not mention the rest of it.~
@2477 = ~Won't you tell me about them?~
@2478 = ~I would like to meet them some day.~
@2479 = ~But wasn't there someone special?~
@2480 = ~Then don't.~
@2481 = ~There is no point. Evereska is far away, and our road is too dangerous to hope to see any of them.~
@2482 = ~If we live, you might, but it is not likely. Besides... you will not be welcome. Your heritage is too well known.~
@2483 = ~Perhaps. But now, after meeting you, I doubt there will be one ever again.~
@2484 = ~Still, family or not, being close to you is a trial at times.~
@2485 = ~I have been alone for many years. Friends, pastimes, family - there was too little time for this. I am unused to swimming in affection all of a sudden. Sometimes, I wonder whether it would have been better to stay in shadow and alone.~
@2486 = ~I feel the same. It is sudden and uncomfortable.~
@2487 = ~It is different with me. I have never felt happier.~
@2488 = ~Are you capable of feeling joy at all?~
@2489 = ~I am happy with you. I never implied otherwise. But it is hard to forget old habits. I sit at the campfire, turn my head, and see you, smiling at me. Too much happiness can be as disconcerting as too much pain.~
@2490 = ~So, do not be surprised if I do not show my affection as you feel I should. It is simply beyond my ability for the moment.~
@2491 = ~It is all right. I understand.~
@2492 = ~But I want it! I want compliments, kisses, romance!~
@2493 = ~Perhaps some physical closeness will help you show it? Your body may tell a different story.~
@2494 = ~Bah! Why have I chosen a cold wretch over a real man?~
@2495 = ~Thank you, melamin.~
@2496 = ~Would you be walking with me here and now if I was well-versed in the arts of love, I wonder? I may compare your eyes to stars and call your voice dark and alluring music, but will you like it?~
@2497 = ~But you are too beautiful not to be kissed, I agree.~
@2498 = ~There is a time and place for everything. Once you are safe, we may speak of it again.~
@2499 = ~If this is how you feel, I have nothing else to say.~
@2500 = ~You scare me sometimes.~ [O#XAN120]
@2501 = ~My heritage again, is it?~
@2502 = ~Yes, I am a big and scary Child of Bhaal. Fear me!~
@2503 = ~Something flickers in your eyes, and I am again reminded of what you are - and what will happen to you.~
@2504 = ~(sigh) I do.~
@2505 = ~Don't you know what you were born for? You were created with a sole purpose: to die. From your divine sire's point of view, you have no other goal in life. You live, but the essence within you remains, and seeks a release.~
@2506 = ~What will happen? Will your pull for murder keep increasing until you start to kill without thinking? Will you master your essence and become a second Bhaal? Or will it remain like this for an indefinite time, until my heart gives out?~
@2507 = ~You worry too much. All that sets me apart is a couple of weird abilities and some strange dreams.~
@2508 = ~I do not know. But since I cannot change the future, there is no point in worrying.~
@2509 = ~I am not afraid. I will take all the power my heritage is able to give!~
@2510 = ~Flee, if you are scared. I am not.~
@2511 = ~A dark picture indeed. What do I do?~
@2512 = ~My naive <CHARNAME>... You will be proven wrong, I'm afraid.~
@2513 = ~Is there any point in anything at all, then? If you are doomed regardless of what you do... is there?~
@2514 = ~Yes, Xan. There is always hope. Always.~
@2515 = ~None, I fear.~
@2516 = ~What do you propose, instead? To flee?~
@2517 = ~Tell me what to do, then.~
@2518 = ~Will you? Will you place power above love?~
@2519 = ~I will take both.~
@2520 = ~I feared you would. I can only hope that you will live to change your mind.~
@2521 = ~How? Gods do not love like mortals do. When you are worshipped by many, you will not want to be loved by one.~
@2522 = ~Where to? My mission is not complete, and you are still in danger. Besides... while there is hope, I do not want to flee.~
@2523 = ~I do not know. I wish I had a simple answer for your every question, but I do not.~
@2524 = ~(sigh) No. As ever, there is none.~
@2525 = ~None.~
@2526 = ~We are doomed. I understand why you have been alone before: no mortal is able to be close to you. Your transformation into something else is inevitable. It is possible that you will turn into a monster and slaughter me in my sleep even to<DAYNIGHT>. Are you prepared to go on, knowing that it will come to pass?~
@2527 = ~I am. I love you.~
@2528 = ~It will not, Xan. I am not a monster.~
@2529 = ~If you think of me as a monster, then no, I am not prepared to go on.~
@2530 = ~Scared of handling a Bhaalspawn, are you? You disgust me.~
@2531 = ~You are making it harder. Your love will kill me, and mine will not save you.~
@2532 = ~You may become one, and soon. I know next to nothing about your taint, but I am expecting the worst.~
@2533 = ~I shall leave you be, then. Forgive me.~
@2534 = ~And rightfully so, I do not doubt. But you have stated your wishes clearly: I shall leave you be.~
@2535 = ~I swear fealty to you - until your chase ends, at least. But I want a promise from you. Promise me that I will never become your sole hope. Promise me that you will go on, with or without me. I do not want to rob you of your future, if you have any.~
@2536 = ~I promise.~
@2537 = ~I cannot give such a promise.~
@2538 = ~Does it matter? You will love me, whatever happens, won't you?~
@2539 = ~Thank you. I will rest easier tonight.~
@2540 = ~<CHARNAME>, I will not be able to be next to you, knowing that I may break your heart in the end. A stronger man would have run away, and I am far from strong. Promise me, melamin. Please.~
@2541 = ~Very well. I promise.~
@2542 = ~No, I will not.~
@2543 = ~I love you too much to promise you this.~
@2544 = ~I will not deprive you of it. For as long as I can. But I fear it will only hurt you more in the end.~
@2545 = ~Is there any way to free you of your destiny?~ [O#XAN121]
@2546 = ~None that I know of.~
@2547 = ~There might be one. To kill my siblings and ascend.~
@2548 = ~There is one: to give up the essence. But I cannot.~
@2549 = ~There is one. to die.~
@2550 = ~I do not need one. I do not want to be freed.~
@2551 = ~None at all? Is there truly no way you can stop being a Bhaalspawn?~
@2552 = ~I wish I could, but I cannot give up my essence.~
@2553 = ~None, save death.~
@2554 = ~I do not care. I do not want to stop being a Bhaalspawn.~
@2555 = ~You are not powerful enough to compete for Bhaal's legacy. And even if you were, it would be of no use to me, since I would lose you. Is this the road you wish to take?~
@2556 = ~Yes, it is.~
@2557 = ~No. I would give up my essence, if I could.~
@2558 = ~No, but there seems to be no other way.~
@2559 = ~You cannot, but I would give my life for the slightest chance that you could...~
@2560 = ~Wait... you spent years at Candlekeep. Haven't you read anything of the kind? Bhaal had temples in these parts; his clergy must have left something.~
@2561 = ~The members of his clergy might know. I do not.~
@2562 = ~Alaundo wrote: "One of these children must rise above the rest and claim their father's legacy. This inheritor will shape the history of the Sword Coast for centuries to come." I have no choice. I will be forced to take my father's throne.~
@2563 = ~I do not think it is possible at all. Bhaal would not give his offspring a choice.~
@2564 = ~No. Anything but this. Anything...~
@2565 = ~Are you happy as you are? You kill and kill, and it does not end. Do you enjoy this?~
@2566 = ~Murder is my life. Nothing will change this.~
@2567 = ~I need my heritage. It is the key to godhood.~
@2568 = ~I do not, but I cannot do anything about it.~
@2569 = ~Power, and murder. I see.~
@2570 = ~Bhaal's clergy will kill you on sight. No, it's no use.~
@2571 = ~"Must rise above the rest and claim their father's legacy..." No loophole, no escape, nothing we can do...~
@2572 = ~It is frightening that a father would hate his child so.~
@2573 = ~You are so young; you should not die at all. It is unfair, unjust, impossible! If only we could avoid your doom somehow... but there is no way, surely.~
@2574 = ~But while you are still with me... I know that it sounds foolish, but thank you that you live. You are a miracle, <CHARNAME>. My miracle.~
@2575 = ~Thank you. It is nice to feel appreciated.~
@2576 = ~Will you prove it with a kiss?~
@2577 = ~Not for long. Even a miracle gets tired of unceasing doomsaying, and this miracle is no exception.~
@2578 = ~A miracle is never appreciated in full, is it? Still, I try my best.~
@2579 = ~But of course.~
@2580 = ~I will pay compliments, then. You are beautiful, beautiful, beautiful...~
@2581 = ~You are looking at me. Was there something you wanted to ask?~ [O#XAN122]
@2582 = ~I was meaning to ask: what will we do, once it is over?~
@2583 = ~No, I was simply wondering about your past.~
@2584 = ~Something, yes. Our future, in fact.~
@2585 = ~No, nothing.~
@2586 = ~I will ask you something, then.~
@2587 = ~Over? Child, you delude yourself.~
@2588 = ~What do you wish to know? I...~
@2589 = ~Oh, no. <CHARNAME>, I have just realized... Please, do not tell me that you were viewing me as a tragic and noble figure with a mysterious past.~
@2590 = ~I am afraid I was.~
@2591 = ~Of course not!~
@2592 = ~Well, you do have a mysterious past, and judging by your moonblade, you are nobility...~
@2593 = ~(groan) There is no need to continue. <CHARNAME>, <CHARNAME>, do I look like a prince out of a fairy tale to you? A doomed one, perhaps, but narrators tend to avoid the word. But enough of me.~
@2594 = ~This is a relief to hear. But enough of me; I will tell you of my past another time. Now I would rather ask you.~
@2595 = ~It is simple. We have none.~
@2596 = ~Have you changed your mind about giving up your divinity? What if I told you that the opportunity of freeing you exists? It is not an idle question; I believe I have found a way.~
@2597 = ~Tell me.~
@2598 = ~I would gladly become a mortal, if it is possible.~
@2599 = ~I do not care. I am a Child of Bhaal, and I wish to remain myself.~
@2600 = ~This will never be over. Or do you believe that a powerful being like yourself will ever be left alone? Even if you survive Irenicus, Bodhi and a dozen others?~
@2601 = ~What do you suggest? That I give up?~
@2602 = ~I shall not only survive, I shall destroy them all, so there'll be nothing left to bury!~
@2603 = ~I know. I wish I were anyone but Bhaal's daughter.~
@2604 = ~No, melamin. Of course not.~
@2605 = ~I do not know whether it is an empty hope, but I believe I have found a way.~
@2606 = ~(sigh) My bloodthirsty and power-hungry love. Why do I even stay with you?~
@2607 = ~Magic runs in my family, and so I learned things I would have never heard of otherwise. My people practice High Magic, available only for the chosen few, and dangerous to the extreme, but still practised, even if it requires great sacrifices from the ones performing the ritual. One of these rituals - Suyoll, the Gift of Life, could be the one we are looking for. It is rarely used, mainly to honor heroes and restore to life the undead sages, but as an exception, I could persuade my kin to use it on you.~
@2608 = ~Could you? Will they listen to a nameless elf? You are no great hero.~
@2609 = ~What does it do?~
@2610 = ~Let us assume you could. What happens to me then?~
@2611 = ~Anyone can petition for it, and I am one of the few they call Defenders of Elvendom. They will listen, if not comply.~
@2612 = ~The ritual will restore you. From what I know, it cancels curses of any nature, neutralizes all unnatural effects and brings you into harmony with the Weave. Your curse is your heritage, inflicted by Bhaal himself, but the god is dead, and High Magic is alive and strong. Were I myself a High Mage, I would tell you for certain, but as it is, I can only hope it will free you of your taint forever.~
@2613 = ~I think that it is worth a try, once Irenicus is safely out of the way. Unless... unless your heritage shows itself. If it does, you will become a monster, and no ritual will be able to aid you.~
@2614 = ~It is interesting, but I doubt that the High Mages will aid a Bhaalspawn.~
@2615 = ~Impossible. Irenicus will kill me long before we reach Evereska.~
@2616 = ~I am not sure I want to participate. It sounds too dangerous.~
@2617 = ~You gave me hope, Xan. Thank you.~
@2618 = ~I did not say it would be simple. Still, I would give everything to try.~
@2619 = ~He may. He will try for certain. But I am more concerned about the shadows you carry within. If they awaken, nothing and nobody will help you. We must hurry, and find him and Imoen before it happens. I believe that it is time to do so.~
@2620 = ~Not for you, but for the mages performing the ritual. Three are needed, and all three may die in the process. I wish I could die for you three times in a row, instead, but High Magic is beyond me.~
@2621 = ~No, it is I who must thank you. You gave me love. I can never repay you, but that would be a wonderful way of expressing my gratitude.~
@2622 = ~I am more concerned about the shadows you carry within, however. If they awaken, nothing and nobody will help you. We must hurry, and find him and Imoen before it happens. I believe that it is time to do so.~
@2623 = ~I heard you... Was it a nightmare?~ [O#XAN123]
@2624 = ~Oh? Ah, yes, the usual. Irenicus, Bhaal, Sarevok - why do I dream only of ugly people?~
@2625 = ~I... yes. Irenicus said that our meeting was inevitable.~
@2626 = ~No. Why?~
@2627 = ~What did you hear?~
@2628 = ~I dream of Sarevok sometimes. It was a ferocious battle: your half-brother had the uncanny gift of resisting magic. You prevailed, but my nightmares persist... How bad is it for you?~
@2629 = ~I am holding on, but it is unpleasant.~
@2630 = ~Not bad, rather, interesting. I learned some useful things about my divine essence.~
@2631 = ~I had nightmares before, as you remember. I am used to them.~
@2632 = ~I do not know how much longer I can go on.~
@2633 = ~I heard nearly nothing; I was not even sure that it was you. You should not be ashamed, if it was. After long imprisonment and the death of your friends, it should be expected.~
@2634 = ~It was me. I saw Candlekeep and Irenicus once again.~
@2635 = ~Not to<DAYNIGHT>, but I had a nightmare several nights before.~
@2636 = ~Look who is talking! Who was moaning "We're all doomed, so what is the point?" the other night?~
@2637 = ~My rest is unperturbed, if you must know. Calm as a summer's morning.~
@2638 = ~Nothing of the sort happened! <CHARNAME>, you hear only what you want to hear.~
@2639 = ~Nope, you do. I rest without nightmares, so there!~
@2640 = ~Really? Did I imagine "Run from her while you are able," too?~
@2641 = ~It could be. I am sorry.~
@2642 = ~Oh, of course. I am sure. Without a doubt.~
@2643 = ~But you are holding on, and that's what is important. Shall we move on, while you are still able?~
@2644 = ~These are lies, <CHARNAME>. I do not know the cause of your dreams, but neither Irenicus nor Bhaal will tell you anything useful, I assure you.~
@2645 = ~I feel for you. It is most unfair...~
@2646 = ~It does not make you weak. But if it gets worse, talk to me. I am not sure if I can help, but I shall try.~
@2647 = ~Yes... no. Yes! You imagined it, and it is preposterous to assume - ~
@2648 = ~There is no need to be. We both hear what we want, don't we?~
@2649 = ~There is something incredibly powerful about the portents in the night skies. Don't you see it?~ [O#XAN124]
@2650 = ~No. I simply think that it is beautiful.~
@2651 = ~See what? Another prophecy about how we must die?~
@2652 = ~Hmm? What is it you see?~
@2653 = ~Sometimes. I look at the night sky, and the star patterns reveal to me the things to come.~
@2654 = ~It is, but it is a deadly beauty.~
@2655 = ~Yes, but I doubt that you will take it seriously.~
@2656 = ~Then you must see what I see.~
@2657 = ~The time of the great upheaval is near. The constellations are disturbed, the stars shift, and recently, an image of the flaming sword has appeared on the horizon. We're doomed, <CHARNAME>.~
@2658 = ~Why? These are just stars, aren't they?~
@2659 = ~I do not believe that stars form our destiny. We do.~
@2660 = ~I... I am scared.~
@2661 = ~But perhaps you are mistaken, and these are not foreboding signs?~
@2662 = ~You are young, and were raised by humans, but you are still an elf. Our minds are attuned to stellar events; we do not dismiss them like humans do. Here, in the waterfall of starlight, it must be difficult for you to decipher the full sentence of the gods, but step into the shadow, and your eyes will be aware of and sensitive to the smallest detail.~
@2663 = ~Don't be. I am sure the cause of our death will be much more mundane. Besides, who are we to presume that we may read our destiny in the stars? You are divine, but I am not.~
@2664 = ~It may be, I suppose. Listen, and be a judge of that.~
@2665 = ~There is a star I have named yours in my heart. Or, rather, a planet; one of the nine in orbit around Toril's sun. We call her Luridel, and associate her with Erevan Ilesere. He is the most careless, reckless and light-hearted of the Seldarine, and sometimes, your demeanor reminds me of his. But humans call her Coliar, the Philosopher's Star, and associate her with the sage Alaundo, who prophesied your entire destiny. So, this star is yours by right.~
@2666 = ~Luridel. I like it.~
@2667 = ~A nice story, but not quite what I want.~
@2668 = ~But what does it have with our doom?~
@2669 = ~It is not all. Luridel was always known to our people as a very bright, bluish white star. Lately, however, it faded to silver blue, and continues to pale. I have tied it with your destiny; I'm afraid for you.~
@2670 = ~It must mean that I am in great danger. I will have to be careful.~
@2671 = ~I do not know what to think... but thank you for warning me.~
@2672 = ~Xan, it is just a superstition. A simple superstition.~
@2673 = ~As if our regular dangers were not enough, you went and invented one!~
@2674 = ~If we both take care of yourself, we may delay the disaster. But... (sigh)~
@2675 = ~I'd like to say that if we take care of yourself, superstition is all it will ever be. Alas, it is not so.~
@2676 = ~Rest now, <CHARNAME>. I should not have spoken of it with you.~
@2677 = ~I was scared for you today. You nearly got yourself killed.~ [O#XAN125]
@2678 = ~You shouldn't worry about this. I am careful.~
@2679 = ~I still feel dizzy. I hope rest will help.~
@2680 = ~Why would it frighten you so?~
@2681 = ~So very careful that you are swaying as we speak? No, I know that you are doing your best, but it doesn't change anything. I fear for you more than I fear for myself. Why?~
@2682 = ~No wonder, that. You are seriously wounded; I fear you will not wake up at all. (sigh) Why do I care so much?~
@2683 = ~I do not know. You are just another of my temporary companions... and yet, today I felt as if my heart was going to stop. <CHARNAME>, will you stop being so reckless?~
@2684 = ~I will try, but you see how nomadic my life is. I do not control it.~
@2685 = ~That's the way I fight. I cannot change it, not even for you.~
@2686 = ~Nah. That would be boring.~
@2687 = ~For you, Xan - anything.~
@2688 = ~And what will I get in return?~
@2689 = ~I thought as much. One day, I will lay down to rest with a memory of your death in front of my eyes.~
@2690 = ~But no, I will die earlier, of course. Good night.~
@2691 = ~Anything, you say? I wonder...~
@2692 = ~But you are tired, and wounded. Good night.~
@2693 = ~You will not die, isn't it enough for you? Or do you expect a prize for your caution? Take my share of the party spoils, if you wish, but stay alive. For me, and for yourself.~
@2694 = ~I have lingered with you too long. Now your doomed visage emerges before my eyes every time I close them. I will get no rest yet again.~ [O#XAN126]
@2695 = ~Why, I am flattered.~
@2696 = ~Good. I like being thought about.~
@2697 = ~Poor Xan. Do you want me to tell you a bedtime story?~
@2698 = ~Oh. I am sorry.~
@2699 = ~You, thinking about me? Ugh.~
@2700 = ~Does being a possible cause of our doom flatter you? If I do not reverie, I will be useless to you tomorrow.~
@2701 = ~I am sure that a woman as beautiful as you could find some other object to test her charms on. Truly, <CHARNAME>, your flirtations are unnecessary. Not to mention that it will not end well.~
@2702 = ~Oh, no. If you do, I will see your face AND hear your voice after I close my eyes, and the notion of memorizing any spells tonight will become purely laughable.~
@2703 = ~It will pass, I suppose... I hope. But I admit, you are taking up more and more space in my thoughts, as the time passes. It will not end well.~
@2704 = ~Your company is a rare poison. You can occupy a man's mind and do not notice, and yet I do not regret it in the least. Perhaps there is some point in our relationship, after all: learning your moves could advance my enchanting abilities a great deal. Though we are doomed, regardless.~
@2705 = ~Hmm? Oh. Yes. Doomed. I'm off to bed.~
@2706 = ~It is strange, but your company affects me in the same way.~
@2707 = ~Oh, very nice! The two of us, alone, the others are asleep, and you are talking of advancing your magic!~
@2708 = ~We may try. Let us see whether your magic is stronger than mine!~
@2709 = ~Of course. (sigh) Rest well.~
@2710 = ~You are a Child of Bhaal, and my future is not exactly bright, have you forgotten this? Spare your heart, <CHARNAME>, and save mine.~
@2711 = ~But I like you.~
@2712 = ~Can't you forget about this tonight?~
@2713 = ~True. It is time to forget about our affections, then.~
@2714 = ~Whatever. This Child of Bhaal is going to bed.~
@2715 = ~No, <CHARNAME>, I spoke in jest. Never mind; I need to recite my spells.~
@2716 = ~Very eloquent, I see. I will try and stop, but it is pointless to talk to you about it.~
@2717 = ~For once, just this once, I'd like to hold your face in my hands and tell you that you won't get rid of me so easily...~
@2718 = ~But it is pointless. Good night, <CHARNAME>.~
@2719 = ~Your shadow... it has changed!~ [O#XAN127]
@2720 = ~What? Where?~
@2721 = ~It looked strange for a moment, but I thought it was just my imagination.~
@2722 = ~You are imagining things. It looks fine.~
@2723 = ~I... I hope that I was mistaken, but it could have been the mortal form of Bhaal. The Slayer.~
@2724 = ~No!~
@2725 = ~Now you are really stretching.~
@2726 = ~But I am obviously not one.~
@2727 = ~It was not. I saw it, too. A monster with scales and claws, instead of your slender frame.~
@2728 = ~It does now, but a moment before... no...~
@2729 = ~I thought the same. But if it distresses you, we may forget the incident entirely.~
@2730 = ~Yes, let's do that.~
@2731 = ~No, no. I'd like to know what it's all about.~
@2732 = ~I do not - ~
@2733 = ~Yes, of course. I must be tired and thus, prone to my fantasies. My apologies, and good night.~
@2734 = ~I know nothing of how your taint works. You are not a monster yet, but the essence of the dead god within you may think otherwise. Or was it a warning? A hallucination?~
@2735 = ~I fear it might mean that I am no longer in control of myself.~
@2736 = ~A warning, I guess.~
@2737 = ~I would prefer to think it was only a dream.~
@2738 = ~It could have been a dream, I suppose. I must be tired and thus, prone to my fantasies. My apologies, and good night.~
@2739 = ~A warning, a premonition, an indication of ill fortune... yes, you are likely correct. (sigh) I wish I could help, but everything I am able to think of is pathetic. What could I do to avert the danger? Hold your hand in the darkness? Stroke your hair and whisper soothing words? Pointless.~
@2740 = ~Totally pointless. Good night.~
@2741 = ~Pointless? I beg to differ.~
@2742 = ~Actually, I would very much like that.~
@2743 = ~Good night... How ironic it sounds.~
@2744 = ~But if you do... I will do my best to comfort you, a'mael mellonamin. My beloved friend...~
@2745 = ~Will you sit with me in the common room, before you retire?~ [O#XAN128]
@2746 = ~It is warm, and cosy... all right.~
@2747 = ~No, Xan. I am too tired.~
@2748 = ~Whatever for?~
@2749 = ~(sigh) You will never cease to surprise me. Thank you.~
@2750 = ~Thank you... Here, sit next to me.~
@2751 = ~I want to... tell you something. After that, you may not fall asleep easily. Will you listen?~
@2752 = ~Perhaps. Start, and I'll tell you when to stop.~
@2753 = ~Of course, Xan, what is it?~
@2754 = ~No, I want no nightmares tonight. I am off to bed.~
@2755 = ~Of course. Is this the appropriate time to get senselessly drunk, I wonder?~
@2756 = ~Whatever for? Ah, I see. Should I take it that you dislike my company?~
@2757 = ~No, I am just tired.~
@2758 = ~Glad you realized it.~
@2759 = ~Why are you always thinking the worst? No, I was just wondering. I will sit with you.~
@2760 = ~Xan, you will be surprised, but I adore your company! Come, join me near the fire.~
@2761 = ~I dreamed my life away, it seems. And it is high time to face reality. Starting now. Excuse me.~
@2762 = ~Twenty years ago, a group of human adventurers attacked elven travelers near the High Forest. The elves were killed. One of them was a Greycloak.~
@2763 = ~We exact revenge for our own. It cannot happen otherwise - otherwise it would not be us. I led the group sent to deal with the offenders - permanently.~
@2764 = ~To kill them? But I thought that elves are wise and merciful.~
@2765 = ~Why? What had they done to you, personally?~
@2766 = ~As it should be. Continue.~
@2767 = ~What happened then?~
@2768 = ~Enough, Xan. I no longer want to listen.~
@2769 = ~They killed some of my kin, without an apparent cause to do so. We could not let them go, <CHARNAME>. I could not.~
@2770 = ~There were markings - a piece of bread marked with human teeth, a broken knife, a piece of a bloodied rope... a severed arm. We found the trail within an hour, and were following it for two days. We found them.~
@2771 = ~There were twenty of them. Hungry, dirty, sunken, ragged - Athkatlan nobles call them human trash. I called them murderers.~
@2772 = ~But there was an obstacle. Among them stood women and children. Some barely old enough to walk, some already wielding knives with surprising skill - skill they must have honed on live victims. Still, many were helpless.~
@2773 = ~What did you do?~
@2774 = ~Did you let them go?~
@2775 = ~And you and your men... killed them all?~
@2776 = ~I could not let them go. How could I?~
@2777 = ~But I was hesitant. It was not what I expected at all... and my younger colleague, whose brother was killed in that ambush, took charge. Or, rather, took aim - at the smallest child.~
@2778 = ~Oh dear.~
@2779 = ~And WHAT did you DO?~
@2780 = ~Eye for an eye, eh?~
@2781 = ~This is monstrous! How could you allow it!~
@2782 = ~Xan, just get away from me. Forever, if you please.~
@2783 = ~I could not allow it... but I could not allow the murderers to go free, either. It was one of the most difficult decisions in my life.~
@2784 = ~I took a shot. The elven boy fell at my side with a dart in his shoulder, and humans backed away. They were ready to use our squabble and attack - but I did not give them time. I recall myself becoming angry - angry enough to sense their fear with ridiculous ease. They were forced to answer my questions - and those who took actual part in the murder were executed on the spot. Seven survived, and were chased from our lands that very night.~
@2785 = ~I still cannot come to terms with it. I turned against one of mine to preserve justice. A life of an elf against an empty word - and the word won. What had I done? A betrayal, a brutal murder, a mistake?~
@2786 = ~You saved an innocent life that day. It means much.~
@2787 = ~Of course you made a mistake! You weakened your group - you could have been killed, all of you!~
@2788 = ~How could you turn against your kin? It is treachery of the worst sort!~
@2789 = ~You killed nearly all the humans! Was that justice?~
@2790 = ~It was the best you could do, I suppose.~
@2791 = ~I do not know, Xan. It is for you to figure out.~
@2792 = ~You will not even listen to the rest of it? Not even - ~
@2793 = ~(sigh) But of course... Good night.~
@2794 = ~I had nearly lost the lives of others. Noble acts are foolish and irresponsible, and this one was no exception.~
@2795 = ~(sigh) I know. But would it have been better to kill each and every human? I do not think so.~
@2796 = ~Surprisingly, my men accepted it afterwards, even the one I wounded. I... I do not think I had, myself.~
@2797 = ~I think it was... I do not know.~
@2798 = ~I suppose so. I am not proud of it, however.~
@2799 = ~I tried, <CHARNAME>. Twenty years is a long time to figure it out, don't you think?~
@2800 = ~But enough of this, I suppose. Thank you... for listening.~
@2801 = ~But... thank you, <CHARNAME>. For your - understanding.~
@2802 = ~So beautiful, and so drunk. I did not expect this of you.~ [O#XAN129]
@2803 = ~N-neither (hic!) did I.~
@2804 = ~Oh, Xan! Hi, Xan! See, I'm drrrrrrrrrunk!~
@2805 = ~"My Ma, she had a cow, had a cow, had a cow..." Moo!~
@2806 = ~Your health, my friend! Go ahead, f-fill a glass!~
@2807 = ~Are you even able to go anywhere?~
@2808 = ~Yes! I stand prrrrroud and dignified!~
@2809 = ~A bottle or two, and then, p-perhaps...~
@2810 = ~And if n-not? What then?~
@2811 = ~This I see.~
@2812 = ~(groan) <CHARNAME>, I believe in your talents, but the time for them has not yet come. Faerun is not ready for such... magnificence.~
@2813 = ~No, thank you.~
@2814 = ~<CHARNAME>, you are - how shall I put this? - unstable. I suggest you go upstairs and rent a room, before more harm is done.~
@2815 = ~But... this look in your eyes... I am growing worried. Are you yourself?~
@2816 = ~No, I am going t-to turn (hic!) into a monster and start b-biting heads off any moment! Prepare to m-meet thy DOOM!~
@2817 = ~Why, I am very, very much myself. Come with me upstairs, and I'll show you.~
@2818 = ~G-good idea. (hic!) Night.~
@2819 = ~A Bhaalspawn is fearsome, but trust me, a drunk female Bhaalspawn is not. And it does not look flattering, either. Please, go upstairs and have some rest.~
@2820 = ~I will, if you come with me. You will keep me company tonight, won't you?~
@2821 = ~Righty-mighty. Rest. Suuure. Rest, I am cooooooming to get youuuuu!~
@2822 = ~No way!~
@2823 = ~<CHARNAME>, let alone the fact that you will regret it in the morning, and some of your present, past or future companions will have my hide, you may indeed bite my head off. I would not like to experiment, not with you in this state.~
@2824 = ~Besides... you will not remember it in the morning, at any rate... I would give anything to be with you tonight, were it your heart's desire instead of drunken ravings. Come, I'll help you upstairs.~
@2825 = ~No, you will stumble on the stairs if you go alone. Or stumble into another's room, more likely, and Corellon knows how this may end. Wait, and I will help you up. Seldarine, what have I done to deserve this?~
@2826 = ~You are the leader, certainly. Lead us, then. I am sure you know how eager we are all to die in your drunken name.~
@2827 = ~These are not temples, but foreboding monstrosities. Do humans worship gods only out of fear?~ [O#XAN130]
@2828 = ~These buildings do not look all that foreboding to me.~
@2829 = ~Elves do not, why should humans be any different?~
@2830 = ~Careful, Xan. I venerate a human god.~
@2831 = ~The Seldarine and human gods are as different as ice is from water. While Corellon is a creator and protector who only asks that his worshippers do not commit evil deeds, Helm insists on a long, cruel and cold dogma, Lathander requires numerous offerings, Talos threatens endlessly, not to mention Auril, Umberlee, Cyric, Mask - oh, and your humble father. Why people turn to these gods is beyond me.~
@2832 = ~To each his own.~
@2833 = ~Because they are lonely.~
@2834 = ~It is not so. There are human gods who are no less benevolent than the Seldarine.~
@2835 = ~Are you asking me to convert?~
@2836 = ~No? Nor the creaks and buzz from Talassans, nor the severe cold emanating from Helm's temple, nor the cruel and crude statues at the headquarters of the local paladin order? I am surprised.~
@2837 = ~Because our temples look different. I never entered Corellon's abode in fear to be cut down by a hard-faced guard, or to be struck by lightning.~
@2838 = ~I have noticed, and it does not make sense to me at all. You are an elf; you are divine. Why would you do this?~
@2839 = ~It does not hurt to have someone to pray to.~
@2840 = ~I grew up among humans. It is only natural to me.~
@2841 = ~Nobody loves a Child of Bhaal. My deity does.~
@2842 = ~Because no elven deity would have me.~
@2843 = ~To pray to, <CHARNAME>? Or to talk to?~
@2844 = ~Do you imply that I am lonely?~
@2845 = ~To pray to. I need a deity, not a friend.~
@2846 = ~To talk to, I suppose.~
@2847 = ~I still fail to see why. Your upbringing was unfortunate, but now your eyes are open. You are an elf, if an unusual one.~
@2848 = ~Why do you turn to gods, <CHARNAME>? What do you seek? Help, protection, knowledge? Love?~
@2849 = ~Protection, knowledge, guidance.~
@2850 = ~My deity makes me feel that I am not alone.~
@2851 = ~I just need to know that there is someone up there watching over me.~
@2852 = ~Love. Since I found none in the real world, I turned to the spiritual one.~
@2853 = ~I do not consider myself a religious woman.~
@2854 = ~What do you seek?~
@2855 = ~The Seldarine would not push you away because of your sire. I'd like to say that no elf would, either, but alas, it is not so.~
@2856 = ~Seldarine, no! I am only asking for your opinion, though you are hardly well-versed in these matters.~
@2857 = ~There might be, since you are speaking of them with such emotion. But I see these buildings, these crowds, and I find no proof of your words.~
@2858 = ~This is a mystery to me. I hoped you would shed light on this matter, but I see you will not.~
@2859 = ~I would have never guessed you were affected by loneliness. Not you. But if my company could help...~
@2860 = ~It could. I am relying on it, in fact.~
@2861 = ~I will manage. I am used to it, after all.~
@2862 = ~I am not alone. I have my religion, remember?~
@2863 = ~Bah, of course not! Who would tolerate such a whiner as you?~
@2864 = ~Lonely? Yes, I suppose that I am.~
@2865 = ~No, not in the least.~
@2866 = ~Are you? Do you revere gods at all, Xan?~
@2867 = ~I see. Of course, someone as beautiful as you will never be.~
@2868 = ~These are the exact goals of Corellon. You are a true elf, it seems.~
@2869 = ~Up there? (sigh) Given your heritage, 'down there' seems more likely. But I understand.~
@2870 = ~No wonder. Since people might venerate you in the nearest future, it would make little sense if you revered a deity yourself.~
@2871 = ~I revere the Seldarine and Corellon, as almost any elf, but little good it does me. No certainty, no luck, and the promise of death ahead. Sometimes I think that any religion is pointless.~
@2872 = ~To you, it is. No deity would suffer endless whining from their followers. I wonder why Corellon tolerates you!~
@2873 = ~No, it is not. If it were, nobody would worship gods at all.~
@2874 = ~It might be, but if people find solace in it, why not?~
@2875 = ~It is. Gods or not, we shall die anyway.~
@2876 = ~I thought you did. Obviously, I was mistaken.~
@2877 = ~I would much rather find solace in other things. The Seldarine are a great comfort, but when one takes his eyes off the sky, he is still alone.~
@2878 = ~True enough. It is a pity...~
@2879 = ~Oh. In this case, I promise not to disappoint.~
@2880 = ~At times like this, I feel at one with the world without and the world within.~ [O#XAN131]
@2881 = ~Why is this?~
@2882 = ~Of course. We are in the heart of the forest, after all.~
@2883 = ~And I feel sick! Insects, damp, smell - it's a swamp!~
@2884 = ~Because of our connection to nature. Don't you sense it here, now? We are in the heart of the forest. Open up to it.~
@2885 = ~You will hear every living creature here. If you hold out your palm, you'll feel the grass moving. If you straighten your ears, you'll hear the birds. In the city, their chattering grinds on my fractured nerves, but here, it is nothing short of music.~
@2886 = ~I think... I think I can hear it, too.~
@2887 = ~Nonsense! Xan, shut up! You are only making it worse.~
@2888 = ~Feeling nature will not defend me from the Shadow Druids - or Bhaal.~
@2889 = ~What will it give me?~
@2890 = ~Don't you like the forest? You are elven, <CHARNAME>. Will you deny your nature?~
@2891 = ~If accepting it means enjoying this bog, then yes!~
@2892 = ~Why should every elf like the forest?~
@2893 = ~It is still better than stone labyrinths of human cities. You may not like it, but your body does: here, among the trees, you look better than you ever did in Trademeet, or indeed Athkatla.~
@2894 = ~Your spirit is a perfect defense against Bhaal. If you allow your mind to become truly elven, you will muffle the voice of your taint. And then you will be able to live... to breathe freely... to love. Do you want to?~
@2895 = ~What, to live or to love?~
@2896 = ~Certainly. Will you teach me?~
@2897 = ~I prefer to leave it as it is.~
@2898 = ~What is the point? I am doomed, Xan. My elven heritage will not help me.~
@2899 = ~Do you want me to become a numb and blind spellcasting automaton, instead? I will.~
@2900 = ~This, <CHARNAME>, depends only on you.~
@2901 = ~It will be my pleasure - if not a long one.~
@2902 = ~My company affects you, I see. Do not doom yourself, <CHARNAME>. Unlike me, you are young, and have the power to choose and change. Do not discard it.~
@2903 = ~Oh, no. Close your eyes. Don't even look there.~ [O#XAN132]
@2904 = ~Hey, let me go! Why do you fret all of a sudden?~
@2905 = ~Yes, I know there is a Shadow Dragon here. So what?~
@2906 = ~Very well, I am not looking. What now?~
@2907 = ~Xan, leave me be! Everyone, weapons at the ready! ATTACK!~
@2908 = ~This hall has been a dragon's lair for generations. If we linger here another moment, we are dead - we are no match for the creature's power. Knowing your temper, I am tempted to grab you in my arms and carry you out, but I'd rather you led us yourself. Would you?~
@2909 = ~Well, if you are afraid...~
@2910 = ~I would. I agree, it is too powerful for us.~
@2911 = ~I will lead you out. But we shall return, mark my words. And you, too, lizard!~
@2912 = ~No, we are going to do battle. But you'll protect me, won't you?~
@2913 = ~Charge!~
@2914 = ~"So what?" Do you know what this creature is capable of?~
@2915 = ~Now we shall quickly and quietly move towards the other exit. Very quietly, if you please.~
@2916 = ~Foolish girl, don't you even think of it! It will consume you - literally! Stop and listen.~
@2917 = ~I am. A coward, a milksop, a failure - I would admit anything to see you out of here, alive.~
@2918 = ~Indeed. A foe this powerful will always be a danger.~
@2919 = ~Come. I want to see you out of here, alive.~
@2920 = ~You will die. It is as simple as that. I am not the all-powerful sage to save you. Step back, close your eyes and think again. There is yet time to reconsider, and run.~
@2921 = ~The only thing you can do well...~
@2922 = ~Do you see these demon heads? The mage had a strange sense of humor, I would say.~ [O#XAN133]
@2923 = ~Many Planes are inhabited by demons. Lavok simply reflected it.~
@2924 = ~Do not worry, they will not eat you.~
@2925 = ~I'd rather leave as soon as possible, instead of discussing Lavok's taste in engineering.~
@2926 = ~I suppose we are meant to feed a demon heart to one of those. Let's do it.~
@2927 = ~The Planes... I dreamed of visiting the Planes during my first years at the Academy. Then I learned that not all of them were populated by benevolent creatures, and the desire cooled down, as you might imagine.~
@2928 = ~But I would still like to travel the Planes, if it gets you away. Away from the assassins, bounty hunters, Irenicus, and lastly, from the Abyss, where we currently are. If there is a place where you can be happy, I would gladly take you there. Could it be possible?~
@2929 = ~Er... Xan, get away from this thing. We are in the Abyss already, I do not want to end up somewhere worse!~
@2930 = ~It could be wonderful. But do you know how to assign the correct destination to the Sphere?~
@2931 = ~Yes! There are so many things we can do: visit Sigil, meet the Lady of Pain, take part in the Blood war...~
@2932 = ~So, we could go anywhere? Even to Arvandor?~
@2933 = ~I am not scared of these; they are harmless. But they have reminded me of the Sphere's true purpose - planar travel.~
@2934 = ~Wait a moment. Does it mean that if we feed a demon heart to the Sphere, we may go anywhere? Visit different Planes, not only the Prime?~
@2935 = ~Why, yes. This is the whole point of the Planar Sphere.~
@2936 = ~I think so. Hmm, it sounds interesting...~
@2937 = ~Only the Prime Material Plane, I suppose.~
@2938 = ~But what would be the point in building such a complex mechanism, if it only had a single destination? No, I believe it was built to travel the Planes at will.~
@2939 = ~Of course... I have not thought of that...~
@2940 = ~No, I do not. Had I enough time, I could try, but since demons can enter this chamber any moment, I'd rather not risk it.~
@2941 = ~(gulp) The B-blood war?~
@2942 = ~But of course! We shall kill all the tanar'ri... or glabrezu? Never mind. And then, of course, there are the Nine Hells, and Mount Celestia - we could rival the gods!~
@2943 = ~No, forget I said this. It seems too dangerous. Say, what about visiting Arvandor?~
@2944 = ~It is all well and good, but do you know how to control the Sphere?~
@2945 = ~Arvandor? We could, I suppose, had both of your parents been mortal. But as it is...~
@2946 = ~The... gods? No! I... I think that you are quite well off on this Plane. If you do not mind, we shall delay planar travel for... an indefinite time.~
@2947 = ~Seldarine, how could I suggest it in the first place? The Lower Planes are exceedingly dangerous, the Land of Eternal Bliss is closed to you because of your heritage, and what remains? Empty, desolate lands a rare traveler wants to visit. Do forgive me, <CHARNAME>. I gave false hope to you.~
@2948 = ~I am used to having no hope, do not worry.~
@2949 = ~Forget it. I never wanted to travel, anyway.~
@2950 = ~And I so wanted to travel...~
@2951 = ~I could say I pity you, but it is not so. The feeling is different, more tender. Perhaps humans are right, and love starts its way in pity? If so, logically, worship and admiration should end it... but they do not. I admire you and pity you at the same time.~
@2952 = ~Strange, isn't it?~
@2953 = ~Then your life must be a nightmare, since you were forced to travel quite a lot. But you found resolve to enter this venture, and I salute you.~
@2954 = ~It is all my fault, I know. I wanted the best, but it turned out as always. (sigh) There was no point.~
@2955 = ~Now I regret accepting my mission the most.~ [O#XAN134]
@2956 = ~Please, please, not "We're all doomed" again!~
@2957 = ~What mission?~
@2958 = ~Because of the vampires. Whether we are working for them, or working against them, I am doomed to die by their hand. I will be denied Arvandor, and so will you. But you have no afterlife either way, so it is irrelevant.~
@2959 = ~But we are. It is not wise to close your eyes to the upcoming death. If we face it, we may escape it. It is hardly likely... but there is hope.~
@2960 = ~No, forget my words. There is none.~
@2961 = ~The mission I was given in Evereska, my forgetful friend. To investigate the sudden increase of shadowy activities in Athkatla, and to find out whether the rumors were true, and sentient undead indeed had a part in it.~
@2962 = ~We shall die, irrevocably, and very soon. To think about my own death is painful enough, but of yours... no, I will not start it now. I will do my best to die before you and not witness it. But if I die, there will be nobody left to bury me properly, in the way of the elves. It is not the most inspiring of thoughts.~
@2963 = ~You will be dead, why should you care?~
@2964 = ~How are the elves buried? Tell me.~
@2965 = ~Why wouldn't you consider the idea that we will *not* die?~
@2966 = ~I care, because it matters. These things make us who we are - an ancient race with traditions bred in our bones. You will understand, if you live long enough.~
@2967 = ~No, no. It is not the best subject for discussion, and I would not want you to do it, in any case. You have suffered enough.~
@2968 = ~<CHARNAME>, the idea is ridiculous. We will die. To assume the opposite is as futile as to expect the sunrise in the middle of the night.~
@2969 = ~I should not have started this, I know, but it is important to me. If I die suddenly, without a farewell and with no hope for resurrection, do not allow the monsters to desecrate my body. I will be shielding you until my last moments, whatever you do, but I want to die calmly. Will you do this for me?~
@2970 = ~I swear to you, I will.~
@2971 = ~We might have to run to save our lives. I do not promise anything.~
@2972 = ~I could not care less.~
@2973 = ~Thank you. If it comes to pass, I will be content.~
@2974 = ~Then run, and live. It will be consolation enough.~
@2975 = ~No, of course you could not.~
@2976 = ~What happened? Imoen is not herself; has he done the same to you?~ [O#XAN135]
@2977 = ~He has. My spirit is gone.~
@2978 = ~She is a Child of Bhaal, too. Irenicus has stolen our souls.~
@2979 = ~It does not concern you. Get moving!~
@2980 = ~You are dead. It is over, then. All is lost...~
@2981 = ~Forgive me. It is hell to you, I know. We are equipped; if we run, and confront him right now, you may yet have a chance. His sister will hinder us... but I will have her head, if she stands in the way. Let us go.~
@2982 = ~Of course. You are alive, and that is what is important.~
@2983 = ~I knew it would end in disaster, but this! No, I cannot make it any further.~ [O#XAN136]
@2984 = ~Do not speak nonsense! We'll make it.~
@2985 = ~What of me? Do you think that becoming a monster is a refreshing experience?~
@2986 = ~Stop this! Irenicus is near. I need you strong and focused.~
@2987 = ~If we win, I will never become a Slayer again. Come. It will be all right.~
@2988 = ~So, you want to die? Do you need help, hmm?~
@2989 = ~What... what is the point, <CHARNAME>?~
@2990 = ~I do not know... I do not care! All this time, you were a monster, and I was a fool!~
@2991 = ~Sweet dreams...~
@2992 = ~Oh, I do not doubt that you are able to provide it.~
@2993 = ~The essence of Murder... I never understood what it truly meant. Now I do. I have seen much pain in my life, but none so horrible as this. Seeing you as a monster... no, I will not go on to see more. This is the end.~
@2994 = ~If we reach Irenicus, he will destroy us. If we win... I do not know what happens. Will you die? Will you remain a... a what you are? Will you become <CHARNAME> again?~
@2995 = ~I am <CHARNAME>. The change was only temporary.~
@2996 = ~I do not know, but it is worth a try.~
@2997 = ~Oh, very well. Let us lie down and die. Is that what you want?~
@2998 = ~No, no and no! Open your eyes! Whatever the outcome, you will be forced to become a monster again and again, until nothing remains of you. If we kill Irenicus, we will not save your life. We will only prolong your existence.~
@2999 = ~I want... I want to tell you that there has never been anyone quite like you - for me, at least. That a woman like you deserves to love and to be loved until the end of time.~
@3000 = ~But with every passing moment, I understand more and more clearly: I will never say this. I will not dare to. You measure your years in corpses, and love... love is a fragile thing. Murder smothers it down in an instant.~
@3001 = ~So, Irenicus fled, leaving you soulless and a danger. What do we do?~ [O#XAN137]
@3002 = ~Follow him, of course!~
@3003 = ~What is the point? I am doomed.~
@3004 = ~A danger? A danger to him or a danger to you?~
@3005 = ~We shall. But what do we do, <CHARNAME>? The two of us - is there any point for us to continue?~
@3006 = ~You are doomed, and I am going to make things even worse for you. I... I have come to a difficult decision, and I want you to hear it.~
@3007 = ~To both of us, I fear, though Irenicus might think differently.~
@3008 = ~The question was rhetorical: my mind is made up. I could not take your Slayer transformation lightly. This beast will tear me in two - sooner or later, one way or another. To hold you, and to know that you may lose control any moment and rip my head off with a single gesture - no, I cannot live with this.~
@3009 = ~I... admire you. More than I can say. I am sorry.~
@3010 = ~What is there to say? I am sorry, too.~
@3011 = ~A coward, and a traitor, at that.~
@3012 = ~Another in your stead would react differently.~
@3013 = ~But you are not leaving, are you?~
@3014 = ~Xan, I love you...~
@3015 = ~Thank you, <CHARNAME>. The sorrow is all mine, I hope.~
@3016 = ~Very much so. I am sorry, <CHARNAME>.~
@3017 = ~Alas, you have chosen the wrong man for your venture.~
@3018 = ~I will not abandon you. Irenicus... we shall get him, even if I have to die in the end. For what he has done, he will cease to exist. But I will not stay afterwards. To admire you and to be afraid of you at the same time... it will not end well.~
@3019 = ~It will not work, <CHARNAME>. May stars watch over you, for I cannot.~
@3020 = ~(You wake up in Xan's embrace...)~ [O#XAN000]
@3021 = ~Xan?~
@3022 = ~(sneak out quietly)~
@3023 = ~(sigh) I suppose it is too late to insist that nothing has happened, is it?~
@3024 = ~I suppose so.~
@3025 = ~Would you want to?~
@3026 = ~Uh-huh.~
@3027 = ~But what *has* happened? Do you remember?~
@3028 = ~Nothing has happened. It was a mistake. Get dressed, and let's go.~
@3029 = ~Ah, you are awake. No, <CHARNAME>. You shall have to... ah, lie it out, I'm afraid.~
@3030 = ~Very well, then... what do we do?~
@3031 = ~Why don't we continue what we started, hmm?~
@3032 = ~What do you want us to do?~
@3033 = ~I do not know. It's up to you.~
@3034 = ~Forget the last night. Nothing happened, and nothing will.~
@3035 = ~I would... though letting you go now would probably be the hardest decision of my life. But it is impossible, I see.~
@3036 = ~Certainly. I assure you, you are not the only one who wants to forget this... unfortunate incident... entirely, however hard it might be.~
@3037 = ~*We* started? I beg to differ.~
@3038 = ~Some, but now is not the time to go into fine detail. It will not end well.~
@3039 = ~<CHARNAME>, why did you have to do this in the first place?~
@3040 = ~Because I love you. And I want to be with you. Isn't it simple?~
@3041 = ~Do what? This? Aaaah, this! He-he. This. Now, why don't I - ~
@3042 = ~Mmm? But look at you... this body, these muscles... You know, you are more manly that I have thought, without those robes... so pleasant to touch...~
@3043 = ~Don't you blame me, Xan! It is your fault as well as mine... if you call it a fault, of course.~
@3044 = ~Very. Were your sire a mortal, I would echo your sentiment. But as it is...~
@3045 = ~Ooh... <CHARNAME>... stop it!~
@3046 = ~Hmm? Stop what?~
@3047 = ~Very well, I am listening.~
@3048 = ~Not in this lifetime.~
@3049 = ~Yes, it is my fault... and while I freely admit it was a mistake, I do not feel guilty in the least. (sigh) Shameful, I know.~
@3050 = ~Nothing! We need to talk, not... Please, listen.~
@3051 = ~Our time together was wonderful... and may be, later. But there is your taint. You may consider my fears ridiculous, but I do not. I am afraid... not of you, but of what you may become. When you are angry, happy, or scared, you are not in control of your emotions, and your taint may manifest itself.~
@3052 = ~I do not want us to take risks, not unless we find a cure; I told you, it exists. For the time being, we must wait and pray that you do not become a monster. There is no other way, melamin. At least, others do not know of our drunken escapade... but please, let us not talk of this further.~
@3053 = ~A pity. Very well, to<DAYNIGHT> was the last time... but I am not finished with you, yet.~
@3054 = ~I understand. Shall we go, then?~
@3055 = ~There must be one. If you do not love me for what I am, do you love me at all?~
@3056 = ~I am sick and tired of your fears! Get away from me!~
@3057 = ~(sigh) You are intent to take all risks possible, are you?~
@3058 = ~Yes... (sigh) Though I do not want to, I admit.~
@3059 = ~I will cheapen the words if I keep repeating them, and you know it full well. Yes, <CHARNAME>. Regardless of your pranks, I do. Come, our enemies await.~
@3060 = ~Reckless little suicide monger! Do you have any idea of what you have done? It was dangerous beyond all bounds! Why, why do you insist on sticking your nose into every hole?~ [O#XAN138]
@3061 = ~Stop shouting, will you? Yes, I like adventure. So what?~
@3062 = ~Well, kill the monster, take the treasure - you know how it goes.~
@3063 = ~I thought you liked me for who I was.~
@3064 = ~If you are scared, you may leave.~
@3065 = ~Hey, calm down! It is not like it was the first dragon I killed, anyway.~
@3066 = ~Hey, calm down! It is not like it was the first Demilich I killed, anyway.~
@3067 = ~(sigh) I know. But you were a within a hairbreadth of death... and I could not do anything. I would kill anyone who would harm a hair on your head, but a demon, a dragon or a lich would be too much even for me.~
@3068 = ~There is a bright side, Xan. We are becoming powerful. These battles are preparing me for Irenicus.~
@3069 = ~Do not torment yourself. You care, and it is enough for me.~
@3070 = ~Your concern is touching, but hardly necessary. More, it is annoying.~
@3071 = ~Yes, yes. Now, enough dallying here!~
@3072 = ~I do. I adore you for who you are. But how will I show it to your lifeless body? Or to a pile of dust you are going to become?~
@3073 = ~How, you say? Do you want me to show you, hm?~
@3074 = ~I understand your fears, but there is nothing I can do.~
@3075 = ~All right. I'll wave the adventure goodbye and settle down with you. For a month or two. Then Irenicus will return for me, and my life of adventure will be *really* over. Is that what you want?~
@3076 = ~All right. I'll wave adventure goodbye and settle down with you. For a month or two. Then I will die without my soul, and Irenicus will go on. Is that what you want?~
@3077 = ~Abandon you here? No. No. The idea is preposterous.~
@3078 = ~Then just take me for what I am.~
@3079 = ~What do you propose? I cannot stop taking risks, even for you.~
@3080 = ~I will be as careful as possible, but I cannot know what awaits me around the corner.~
@3081 = ~Then let's not waste time here! This delay annoys the hell out of me!~
@3082 = ~As opposed to what? Killing another demon, dragon or a mad mage? (sigh) Thrilling perspective, no doubt.~
@3083 = ~A perfect place for the demonstration, I see. No, <CHARNAME>. Another time, perhaps. There are too many concerns at the moment: this place, your heritage, Irenicus...~
@3084 = ~Irenicus. Whatever we speak about, this name inevitably arises. It is a curse. Worse, I know that I will not survive this meeting...~
@3085 = ~Don't you dare say that!~
@3086 = ~*He* will not. You will.~
@3087 = ~(yawn) Here goes Xan the Doomed again.~
@3088 = ~Thank you. If only you remembered this, and were more careful... but with Irenicus standing in your path, it is impossible, I know.~
@3089 = ~Do not start battles such as this, then. This way, you will be free of my 'touching concern' entirely.~
@3090 = ~It is inevitable. But let us not think about the future. Whatever it will be, it has not yet come.~
@3091 = ~But it will...~
@3092 = ~We have done that. We are free. I can scarcely believe it.~ [O#XAN139]
@3093 = ~Yes, killing the Prince of Demons was not an easy feat.~
@3094 = ~Ha! I killed demons by the dozens! This one was no exception.~
@3095 = ~Done what? Killed Demogorgon?~
@3096 = ~Free? From what?~
@3097 = ~Not the Prince of Demons, <CHARNAME>. His avatar. Would the real Demogorgon have appeared here, he would have smeared us in an instant.~
@3098 = ~You were incredibly lucky. Had we lost, our souls would be lying at Demogorgon's mercy. The very idea chills me.~
@3099 = ~Ah, the fact that we could have stayed immured in his lair never reached your mind? I thought not.~
@3100 = ~We could have remained there. All of us. If not for sheer, incredible luck, the sealed chamber of the Watcher's Keep could have become our grave. For all eternity! Seldarine, why do I travel with you? We are surely doomed.~
@3101 = ~Because Suldanessellar needs to be saved.~
@3102 = ~You must help me recover my soul.~
@3103 = ~You need my help for some odd reason.~
@3104 = ~Because we are friends?~
@3105 = ~Because love means more than death?~
@3106 = ~I have no idea.~
@3107 = ~Indeed, and it is high time we traveled there.~
@3108 = ~Yes, I am sorry. Of course I do.~
@3109 = ~My mission, yes. I have discovered enough about the shadowy world of Athkatla, but the main danger remains present.~
@3110 = ~We are... my friend. But still...~
@3111 = ~It does. But is it more powerful than death? I would die for you, but wouldn't you rather have me by your side? I have many reasons to stay alive, as I am sure do you.~
@3112 = ~Still, all these reasons will be vain if I die. I know that it is useless to ask you, but I will: do not rush to face such an enemy next time.~
@3113 = ~You are right. It is useless.~
@3114 = ~This was the last time, I promise.~
@3115 = ~We are adventurers. Deal with it.~
@3116 = ~Sometimes we have to, Xan. There is nothing I can do about it.~
@3117 = ~I doubt there is another Imprisoned One somewhere waiting for us, anyway.~
@3118 = ~(sigh) As I expected.~
@3119 = ~(sigh) No, <CHARNAME>. We have Irenicus to battle, still.~
@3120 = ~You were not *required* to visit the Watcher's Keep, and you were hardly *forced* to open the seals and pull the levers. You had full choice in the matter.~
@3121 = ~(shudder) I should hope not! But, alas, we have Irenicus to battle, still.~
@3122 = ~Ah, but it is useless to continue this discussion. In a tenday, you will probably stumble upon a dragon's lair, and claim you feel obliged to slay the beast. So predictable...~
@3123 = ~It is time. It is time to go and face your destiny. You cannot hide, though I wish you could.~ [O#XAN140]
@3124 = ~We shall be on our way to Imoen and Irenicus as soon as mortally possible.~
@3125 = ~I am not afraid. But there are things for me to do here, still.~
@3126 = ~You are right. I am scared to face Irenicus.~
@3127 = ~Why are you so eager to get us killed?~
@3128 = ~Lead on, then. (sigh) To our doom, I do not doubt.~
@3129 = ~Are they more important than your life?~
@3130 = ~I understand. I am not the bravest of heroes, myself. But ironically, following him will cause you the least harm.~
@3131 = ~Me? No - never! <CHARNAME>, I do not wish us to go unprepared. But time is running short, for you and your friend.~
@3132 = ~If you go now, you will be able to face Irenicus on your terms. But if you stay, he will find you, his valued test subject, once again. They came as you rested, did they not? The bounty hunters he sent for you? They will return, and more will follow.~
@3133 = ~Besides... you are growing paler and thinner as we walk. I doubt it is only the strain of adventuring. What has Irenicus done to you underneath the Promenade? What has he drained you of? What will happen next? Find him, <CHARNAME>, and find out.~
@3134 = ~I feel death in the air. This group is doomed.~ [O#XAN141]
@3135 = ~This group be a damn sight better off without you!~ [O#XANED1]
@3136 = ~By 'this group' I mean you and only you, Edwin.~
@3137 = ~Surprisingly, so do I.~
@3138 = ~Ah, so the other members of this group you appreciate? It is indeed surprising, to say the least.~
@3139 = ~The others I tolerate, as they do not have the inclination to steal my precious scrolls for themselves. Incidentally, I would like my Wish scroll back, if you please.~
@3140 = ~Whatever for? To secure our doom? Regardless, I never had it in the first place.~
@3141 = ~Lying monkey! Admit it, you have it! Give me my scroll!~
@3142 = ~I cannot conjure it up, can I? I have a spare Identify scroll, though.~
@3143 = ~Aaargh! You are so irritating! You have it, I have seen you reading it! What will you use it for? To wish for a painless death? Let me enlighten you: advanced magic is not required in this case. A fireball will do nicely, and I will be pleased to assist.~
@3144 = ~...an interesting scroll indeed. May I keep it?~ [O#XAN142]
@3145 = ~They are mine! Every scroll this party finds is mine! (One can hardly expect a mere apprentice to compete with the vastly superior mind of a trained Red Wizard, in any case.)~ [O#XANED2]
@3146 = ~Indeed? How will you explain the burn holes in my robes, then? Do learn to control your 'vastly powerful mind', Edwin. I have no desire to see the same happening to my body next time.~
@3147 = ~You will, if you do not let go of the scroll. The magic treasure of this party is mine, and mine alone!~
@3148 = ~Here, then. Have it your way, but your power will be the doom of you.~
@3149 = ~Yes! At last! This is it! This has to be... A LARLOCH'S MINOR DRAIN?~
@3150 = ~There is more than enough power in it for you, Edwin.~
@3151 = ~Gahhh! Stand away from me, moronic shaman! Power indeed... just wait until you fall asleep, and then you shall face *true* power...~
@3152 = ~You have been silent as of late. Are you thinking of your newfound heritage?~ [O#XAN143]
@3153 = ~Oh. Well... no. I just not...~ [O#XANIM1]
@3154 = ~Are you unperturbed by it, then? It is strange. I do not know whether I would survive with my mind intact, if I learned something as drastic as that.~
@3155 = ~I'll live. It just takes some time to sink in, you know.~
@3156 = ~I do not, but I can imagine it. It must be a nightmare for you and your <PRO_BROTHERSISTER>.~
@3157 = ~I don't know if it's right to call <CHARNAME> my <PRO_BROTHERSISTER>. I've felt like this for years, but - I wanted <PRO_HIMHER> to be my real <PRO_BROTHERSISTER>, many times, - but not like this. Not with our dear father calling the tune. It's all wrong!~
@3158 = ~If you call <PRO_HIMHER> a <PRO_BROTHERSISTER> in your heart, keep the word, but do not think of your sire. Though I see no point either way.~
@3159 = ~I might. Thanks... I guess.~
@3160 = ~...this is out of the question! An aspiring mage like you should not even try these spells! For now, you are nothing more than a wordy girl, let alone a dangerously reckless one.~ [O#XAN144]
@3161 = ~No more wordy than you, and I've learned things since we last met that you couldn't begin to dream of!~ [O#XANIM2]
@3162 = ~Aw, Xan, I was just teasing you! It was your fault in the first place! "An aspiring mage", my hat!~
@3163 = ~You do not have one. Though it would probably become you: at least, it would hide that dreadful hair of yours.~
@3164 = ~Hey, you... you're smiling!~
@3165 = ~Well, I could not say this seriously, could I? But much has changed since your imprisonment, Imoen. We are more powerful than you perhaps have thought us to be. You will have to work hard on improving your magic, if you wish to be of help.~
@3166 = ~Yeah... I know. I want to scream sometimes, it's so frustrating. But I'll catch on, Xan. Doncha worry.~
@3167 = ~Of course. I pray you have time to do so, before... (sigh)~
@3168 = ~We'll get them. We'll get them, Irenicus and all, and we'll make them pay. We will. I know.~
@3169 = ~This adventure will be our last. So much blood... I am surely dying.~ [O#XAN145]
@3170 = ~I'm not gonna end up dead in this place! I have to get out! We have to! Come, Xan, just a little bit, and then I'll nag <CHARNAME> for rest.~ [O#XANIM3]
@3171 = ~I do not think <PRO_HESHE> will listen. Perhaps I am imagining things, but <PRO_HESHE> does not seem <PRO_HIMHER>self these days.~
@3172 = ~It is... sort of creepy. First <PRO_HESHE> seems normal, and then <PRO_HESHE> looks at me, all empty, and I feel myself backing away...~
@3173 = ~It is different with me. I can feel it. Why?~
@3174 = ~Because your portion of the taint is smaller? I do not know, Imoen. I have doubts that either of you will become normal again, to be honest.~
@3175 = ~I guess we might live through it, you never know. But it's still creepy...~
@3176 = ~You shielded us from your fallen brethren, but are you prepared to stand firm in your beliefs?~ [O#XAN146]
@3177 = ~Undoubtedly. I would do as such again without hesitation.~ [JAHEIRD9]
@3178 = ~Jaheira, it was not an idle question. I respect you, but I do not believe these attacks will stop. My loyalty is to <CHARNAME>, but to whom is yours?~
@3179 = ~To <PRO_HIMHER>. I promised Gorion, and I would have it no other way.~
@3180 = ~I understand. I am sorry for doubting you... I should have known I was wrong.~
@3181 = ~I did not expect this of you at all.~ [O#XAN147]
@3182 = ~I beg your pardon?~ [O#XANJA1]
@3183 = ~You left us to meet certain death. It was pure foolishness: your demise would not have changed anything. But I admire your resolve.~
@3184 = ~Would you not have done the same? It was the only choice I could make.~
@3185 = ~Indeed. But what do we do now? <CHARNAME> is still hunted; you are still considered a traitor.~
@3186 = ~We should watch our backs. There is no other advice I could give at the moment. I need to... think.~
@3187 = ~The recent events make me wonder whether it is wise for you to continue traveling with us.~ [O#XAN148]
@3188 = ~I fear that the actions of my fellow Harpers may have colored your view of me. I am no traitor, Xan.~ [O#XANJA2]
@3189 = ~I know, and I apologize for slighting you, if unintentionally. But... Jaheira, is it not true that rogue Harpers are hunted until the end, and they always, always die, as do those who travel with them?~
@3190 = ~I... I see.~
@3191 = ~Yes, make of this what you will. I am not made of steel; I am afraid.~
@3192 = ~Ahhhh... but there is no point in complaining, is there? I would be the first to damn myself if I insisted on letting you go. No, I shall try to shield you as I have before. Though it will be hard, I admit.~
@3193 = ~This is a difficult situation for all of us. This will take time... but we will manage. We must.~
@3194 = ~I have noticed you scuttling around my things, gnome. I give you a fair warning - ~ [O#XAN149]
@3195 = ~Indeed? What warning would that be?~ [O#XANJN1]
@3196 = ~If I find any of my equipment missing, it will be your last day in this party.~
@3197 = ~You know, you remind me of Xanetta again - when she was alive, that is. She was always afraid someone would steal her things, and so she always carried everything with her. Her knitting basket, her shawl, her spare robes, her notes on cooking - everything. But it didn't help.~
@3198 = ~Jan, please, steer clear of my things. This is all I ask.~
@3199 = ~As soon as I finish the story. You may change your mind then. So, one sweet, sunny day, she went out to visit another relative of hers and took the shortest road through the forest. Alas, the path went right through the anthill, and Xanetta, laden with her belongings, never noticed it.~
@3200 = ~The girl stumbled, and as she carried a honey jar with her - and it got broken, - it proved to be a very lucky day for the ants. Xanetta was less lucky. She twisted her ankle when landing on her knitting basket, and accidentally tore her undergarments with a spare spoon she carried with her - just in case someone invited her to dinner. Well, there was a dinner, and a supper, too, but alas, it so happened that poor Xanetta herself was the supper. I trust she spent some memorable hours on this anthill, though.~
@3201 = ~(sigh) You might just as well admit that you were staring at me. What is it this time?~ [O#XAN150]
@3202 = ~I was just thinking how much you remind me of my cousin Gabber.~ [O#XANJN2]
@3203 = ~Not Xanetta, this time?~
@3204 = ~Well, Xanetta is dead, you see. Gabber is very much alive, thank you. He, too, has a bright, shiny moonblade, blue as you please.~
@3205 = ~I thought we would come to this. Jan, it is not possible. Only moon elves are able to wield these blades and survive. A human will die in an instant, let alone a gnome.~
@3206 = ~But Gabber did not! He was a special gnome, you see. A son of a rogue drow princess and some god, with silver hair, emerald eyes and nose so long it nearly reached the ground! See? Special.~
@3207 = ~So, a moonblade. He was constantly flashing it, sighing mournfully and brooding about the imperfections of this world, mentioning his tragic past once in a while, until - ~
@3208 = ~Until?~
@3209 = ~Until one day, my other cousin settled in the neighborhood. He had golden hair, sapphire eyes, and a moonblade twice as long as Gabber's. His sighs were heard in another city, and... oh, yes, his nose was so long he had to employ a boy with a trolley to transport it. Naturally, all girls abandoned Gabber and started to court the other guy.~
@3210 = ~Is this all? I should hope so: treating a moonblade as the subject of a made-up story does not sit well with me.~
@3211 = ~No? (snicker) I thought you would appreciate it, my dear elf.~
@3212 = ~I believe I did. I would postpone the part where your amber-eyed and raven-haired cousin with a moonblade the size of a greatsword makes an appearance, however.~
@3213 = ~(snicker) If you say so.~
@3214 = ~Don't you miss family on your journeys? Your children, your home?~ [O#XAN151]
@3215 = ~I miss it, truly, the little that I have known of home and the Order.~ [O#XANKE1]
@3216 = ~I do not know what is worse: to have a family and barely know it, or not to start one at all. They say that children are an inspiration in old age, but will we live that long? I think not.~
@3217 = ~I cannot imagine my life without my sweet Vesper and my charming Leona. No, it would not be for me. 'Tis inspiring to know that my legacy would continue, and hollow otherwise.~
@3218 = ~But how hollow is it to know that in a year, your children will be left without a father?~
@3219 = ~Aye, but better thus than not being born at all.~
@3220 = ~I do not know, Keldorn. Our race has never bred in times of war and misfortune. Perhaps it will be the death of us, yet, but nobody will be able to say that we do not care for our offspring.~
@3221 = ~Life is the best gift and care, Xan. You may consider it folly, but I believe it to be our greatest strength.~
@3222 = ~Time will tell, I suppose.~
@3223 = ~Whatever we do, all our efforts end up in vain. Will this ever end?~ [O#XAN152]
@3224 = ~I am indeed troubled by our current course.~ [O#XANKE2]
@3225 = ~Do you see any hope for us, Keldorn? For <CHARNAME>?~
@3226 = ~There is always hope, my friend. Do not let the dark thoughts bring you anxiety. These are dark times, and we must maintain a vigil against despair.~
@3227 = ~What is the point? Hope will not heal our wounds, and will not revive the fallen. It can only get worse... but thank you for your words. If you keep hoping, perhaps I should, too.~
@3228 = ~So should we all, Xan. So should we all...~
@3229 = ~Keldorn, are you well?~ [O#XAN153]
@3230 = ~I am well enough.~ [O#XANKE3]
@3231 = ~I am not so sure. Could it be your age showing itself?~
@3232 = ~Old I may be, but I am not dead yet. Are you eager to get rid of me, since you fear my scrutiny?~
@3233 = ~I doubt your ability in battle, this is all. You look tired and unwell. Continue like this, and you will fall on the spot.~
@3234 = ~My faith in Torm shall keep me for as long as I am needed. Do not be bothered about my condition, Xan. There is strength in this paladin yet.~
@3235 = ~May I ask you a personal question?~ [O#XAN154]
@3236 = ~What is it that you need?~ [O#XANMA1]
@3237 = ~You've lost a loved one, have you not?~
@3238 = ~You know it full well, Xan. Yes, Patrick became a twisted and tormented shadow. I don't know where his spirit wanders now. I... shall not falter, though.~
@3239 = ~We shall join him soon, I suppose. But what I wanted to ask is rather more intimate. Do you... feel guilty because of his death?~
@3240 = ~And why, pray tell, would you ask such a thing?~
@3241 = ~You were the leader of your group, were you not? Older, perhaps, than some. You were responsible, and you let it happen.~
@3242 = ~I do not understand. Are you blaming me?~
@3243 = ~Far from it, Mazzy. I am blaming myself for the same thing. I had to part ways with <CHARNAME> at Baldur's Gate, knowing that <PRO_HESHE> was younger and far less experienced; I abandoned <PRO_HIMHER> to torture and death.~
@3244 = ~And were it only <CHARNAME>... there were others, men and women, who now lie in cold graves. I would not be surprised if you felt the same about your fallen companions.~
@3245 = ~Sometimes... perhaps, yes. But I have done all I could. My conscience is clear, as should be yours, my friend. If Patrick was alive, he would confirm the words my heart knows.~
@3246 = ~If only.~
@3247 = ~Take heart, Xan. We have to go a long way yet, and <CHARNAME> needs our help. Let us not disappoint <PRO_HIMHER>.~
@3248 = ~Why do you bother to continue? What for?~ [O#XAN155]
@3249 = ~How do you mean?~ [O#XANMA2]
@3250 = ~You are the luckiest of us all. You had a home, and parents who welcomed you. But instead of staying with them, you went adventuring, and lost what little you had: freedom, friends, love. Perhaps your destiny lies elsewhere?~
@3251 = ~I am warning you, Xan, one more word about how halflings should tend to the hearth and hide under the bed as bandits approach, and I shall - ~
@3252 = ~I will not chide you for your chosen path, Mazzy. Plenty have tried, I am sure. I am honestly trying to understand you. Why adventuring, why danger? Unlike me, you were not chosen for it; you picked up your sword yourself. Why?~
@3253 = ~Why shouldn't I? Just because I am a halfling does not mean I am a coward! All beings suffer from evil, and therefore, all races should stand united against it.~
@3254 = ~(sigh) You disappointed me. I thought there was something more than this.~
@3255 = ~There *is* much more in my words. It wasn't I who blathered on and on about virtue and goodness until the words became platitudes. But your heart lacks generosity, so you would not believe in the best of intents. Let us continue. Quietly.~
@3256 = ~Again you rushed ahead of everyone! Are you that eager to die?~ [O#XAN156]
@3257 = ~Don't be ridiculous, I know of no such thing!~ [O#XANMA3]
@3258 = ~Oh, you do. Mazzy, you do not want to live, and I understand this. But your death may cause ours, and the very evil you fight against will triumph.~
@3259 = ~Pretty words, from the lips of one who cares nothing about evil.~
@3260 = ~Will you believe me if I say that I care about my fellow companions?~
@3261 = ~You are not a bad person, Xan. But sometimes, I cannot believe that you care about anyone at all. We are all dead to you.~
@3262 = ~Even if you are right, do not risk your life again. You will never defeat all evil in this world; all you will do is hasten our demise.~
@3263 = ~I take risks, because I fight for noble ends in the name of Arvoreen, not because of some romantic foolishness! If it is only your own hide you value, never fear - it will stay intact.~
@3264 = ~How does one expect a wounded mage to perform in... perform in battle? (groan) I am about to die.~ [O#XAN157]
@3265 = ~We must rest and get healthy. It would not do for us to be caught unsuspecting with Minsc in this kind of shape.~ [MINSC84]
@3266 = ~I would rather find a clean and convenient place for rest, to be honest. Here we are not likely to get healthy. Most probably, we'll catch a disease or two.~
@3267 = ~Minsc got a disease once with a pretty lady, but how will simple rest get us a disease? Or does friend Xan mean something else? Eh, Boo?~
@3268 = ~I meant contamination, Minsc. Or common cold, if you insist on plain terms.~
@3269 = ~Your words make sense now, and Minsc agrees. Boo tells me something strange, though. He is musing on elven ladies... but Boo has not been much around lady hamsters lately.~
@3270 = ~Ah. I... see. If we leave the subject alone, then, and find a more appropriate place to rest, or just a healing potion... oh, my senses go mad with the smell...~
@3271 = ~No, no! Boo asks: why do human ladies have some embarrassing diseases, and elven ladies do not?~
@3272 = ~Why is Boo so interested, might I ask? No. No, I won't. No, Minsc, I do not know what to tell you, except that I would not like to discuss those aspects of elven anatomy. It is... unnecessary.~
@3273 = ~Oh well. Boo will have to learn on his own, following the untiring example of Minsc. If ladies of Rashemen and Athkatla love Minsc, there is no reason why elven ladies will not like Minsc and Boo!~
@3274 = ~(groan) Corellon, they are doomed.~
@3275 = ~We are alive - alive! I never expected we would last this long.~ [O#XAN158]
@3276 = ~I think that goes without saying. We have a capable leader.~ [O#XANNA1]
@3277 = ~We do, but thanks to our capable leader, we also have a number of capable enemies. I am astounded that we are still alive.~
@3278 = ~<CHARNAME> is an experienced adventurer, isn't <PRO_HESHE>? That in itself is a good reason. Weren't you with <PRO_HIMHER> when <PRO_HESHE> stopped a war with Baldur's Gate?~
@3279 = ~Stopped a war? <CHARNAME>? This is foolishness, Nalia. Nothing of the sort happened.~
@3280 = ~But I heard - ~
@3281 = ~What you heard was a fanciful exaggeration. In truth, <CHARNAME> accidentally stumbled upon some trouble in the Nashkel mines. Those days, <PRO_HESHE> desperately needed money in order to survive, so <PRO_HESHE> accepted the job. It turned out that the mines were plagued by kobolds, as I knew all too well, for I spent months in the prison beneath the shafts. Our leader engaged in a glorious battle with Mulahey, and the side effect of this battle was <PRO_HIMHER> graciously liberating me.~
@3282 = ~Then <PRO_HESHE> learned that Mulahey was only a puppet, and the leader was someone named Tazok, who kept in check a bandit camp to the southeast of Baldur's Gate. <CHARNAME> arrived too late, however: Tazok was gone, but the documents remained, and so <PRO_HESHE> continued the chase, ending up in the Cloakwood forest, amongst spiders, wyverns and druids, and ended up in the slavers' hideout in the local mines. The slaves, of course, were again liberated... or drowned? I do not remember... But in any case, yet another document - found, of course, in the furthest chamber, by the body of the slavers' leader - pointed <PRO_HIMHER> to the city of Baldur's Gate.~
@3283 = ~There, <PRO_HESHE> kept stumbling around blindly, until <PRO_HESHE> encountered Scar of the Flaming Fist, who asked <PRO_HIMHER> to help him with some investigations. Very conveniently, these investigations concerned the subject of <CHARNAME>'s search: the Iron Throne, the organization behind these barbaric deeds. Eventually, their group was destroyed, as such evil should, and their plot revealed. When the enlightened citizens learned that their weapons rusted and their instruments corroded through no fault of their neighbors', the war preparations stopped on their own accord.~
@3284 = ~But there was a man who wanted to become a god, wasn't there? Sarevok, or so I heard.~
@3285 = ~This... no, I do not want to recall these events. Ask <CHARNAME>, if you wish. Though I would not, if I were you: <PRO_HESHE> seems to be tired of these inquiries, and when <PRO_HESHE> is tired, <PRO_HESHE> is annoyed...~
@3286 = ~...and when <PRO_HESHE> is annoyed, we march for hours on end. Very well, I won't. Thank you for the story, Xan.~
@3287 = ~Do you intend to stay in this group for long?~ [O#XAN159]
@3288 = ~I don't know. Perhaps.~ [O#XANNA2]
@3289 = ~Is this wise? You have relatives, money and safety within your reach. Here all you have is a promise of death.~
@3290 = ~<CHARNAME> needs my help. I will not fail <PRO_HIMHER>.~
@3291 = ~<CHARNAME> will survive without you, without me, and without anyone else, for that matter. But you have a future. Why would you refuse it?~
@3292 = ~I don't. My future is here, Xan. Didn't you say yesterday that I was a talented mage? I could be of help to you all! We've been through so much together...~
@3293 = ~Help comes to those who help themselves. Listen to me, Nalia, and flee this fellowship while you can. I do not want to leave yet another corpse of a friend behind.~
@3294 = ~I know... but I will not fall easily. Thank you for worrying, however.~
@3295 = ~Viconia, could you be a little more - polite?~ [O#XAN160]
@3296 = ~Mmm... what?~ [O#XANVI1]
@3297 = ~Polite, Viconia. Do you know the word?~
@3298 = ~And who is talking? A moaner, a weakling who has no use in this group, hm?~
@3299 = ~Are you baiting me or provoking a fight?~
@3300 = ~A fight? Why would I, darthiir? I am content with my position.~
@3301 = ~I am not, but I shall tolerate your presence, if nothing else. The bile you spit on the others, however, I shall not. Curb your ambition, before you doom us with petty squabbles.~
@3302 = ~I will... think on your words. Oh, and is it true that a jaluk at the Copper Coronet found your nightly performance displeasing?~
@3303 = ~To travel with a drow... if I could, I would end it immediately.~ [O#XAN161]
@3304 = ~Ha! You do not frighten me.~ [O#XANVI2]
@3305 = ~I wish I could claim the same. Your company is more frightening than perhaps anything.~
@3306 = ~It should be, darthiir. I was born of a noble race that deserves its name.~
@3307 = ~Mercy is not one of your virtues, this I know. Why don't you leave this group? You - and we - shall be much safer on our own.~
@3308 = ~It shall be as <CHARNAME> says. For now, <PRO_HESHE> insists that I stay. Is <PRO_HISHER> word not enough for you?~
@3309 = ~I thought you had a will of your own, did you not? Surely, a drow that was born of a noble race will not listen to a mere <PRO_RACE>?~
@3310 = ~I do not need a cowardly dog to dictate me! Begone!~
@3311 = ~Ah, but the sense of joy I now feel!~ [O#XAN162]
@3312 = ~What do you mean?~ [O#XANVA1]
@3313 = ~Bodhi is dead, Valygar. My mission is complete. As soon as Irenicus lies dead, I will return home. It is the most wonderful thing that has happened to me in months.~
@3314 = ~Congratulations, friend. If duty is so important to you, there is no wonder you have been down these last days.~
@3315 = ~Alas, we have nothing else to smile about. <CHARNAME>'s divine spirit remains missing.~
@3316 = ~Our leader's divinity is a foul and dead thing. Let the mage who took it drown in its evil, I say. But since <CHARNAME> cannot survive without it...~
@3317 = ~... we go on.~
@3318 = ~Yes. We go on.~
@3319 = ~How many lives have you ruined, rogue? How many people could sleep unvexed, if not for your intervention? Hunting people as if they were cattle - how barbaric is this?~ [O#XAN163]
@3320 = ~I do not regret my choice in this matter.~ [O#XANYO1]
@3321 = ~You will, once you die. To which deity do you pay your tribute, Yoshimo? What god accepts you?~
@3322 = ~Ilmater.~
@3323 = ~I... I see. If you ask for mercy, then, perhaps, not all is lost for you.~
@3324 = ~Yoshimo has never been a beggar! Why I directed my steps to the Crying God is none of your concern.~
@3325 = ~Very well. Let us move on, then. To redemption or futility, time will show.~
@3326 = ~I assure you, you will not be disappointed.~
@3327 = ~We have made a powerful enemy today. And yesterday. In fact, our number of powerful enemies will soon rival the population of Amn.~ [O#XAN164]
@3328 = ~You think too much and smile too little! We laugh, we live, we own the world!~ [O#XANYO2]
@3329 = ~You will die before you are able to own a hut in the ground. But it is pointless to convince you of anything. Live as you will, rogue, but soon, you will face retribution.~
@3330 = ~Why do you disapprove of my profession so? Yours is by no means saintly enough.~
@3331 = ~I may have to protect myself by unsavory means, but I do not sell people to slavery, as you do.~
@3332 = ~Who told you such garbage? Yoshimo never harmed an innocent man!~
@3333 = ~I wish to believe you. You saved my life more than once, but still, something stops me. (sigh) In such moments, I am often tempted to break my own vows and penetrate a suspect's mind, but, of course, it is no less dishonorable.~
@3334 = ~(gulp) Of course.~
@3335 = ~A bunch of doomed fools. Sometimes I wonder why I joined this lost cause.~ [O#XAN165]
@3336 = ~Don't you think that's a little rude?~ [O#XANAE1]
@3337 = ~No. If I wanted to be rude, I would point out that <CHARNAME> has sunk to appalling lows, using the crippled, fragile and severely weakened to achieve <PRO_HISHER> goals.~
@3338 = ~Are you talking about me? Am I... am I weak to you?~
@3339 = ~You are, Aerie, there is no point in denying it. Had the situation become a little more vulnerable, your inexperience could have been the death of us.~
@3340 = ~I... I do not have as much strength as you or <CHARNAME>, it's true... but must you be so cruel to remind me of it? If you wish me to leave, I will... you just need to say a word...~
@3341 = ~It is not cruelty to you, but mercy. What can you do here but die? You have no real experience in spellcasting; you are not used to long walks; you have gone through a terrible trauma. It is not my decision whether you should go or stay, but I wish it were.~
@3342 = ~(sob!) There is no wonder they sent you away from Evereska: you only say cold, horrid things! <CHARNAME>, I do not want to listen anymore!~
@3343 = ~Are you content with your life on the road?~ [O#XAN166]
@3344 = ~Why do you ask?~ [O#XANAN1]
@3345 = ~Out of curiosity, if you will.~
@3346 = ~Well, since we are allies in battle, I will humor you this time. I question <CHARNAME>'s judgment at times, but I must admit, <PRO_HISHER> leadership is vital to our cause.~
@3347 = ~You take <PRO_HISHER> goals to heart, then?~
@3348 = ~Verily, I do. <CHARNAME> is an impressive... leader.~
@3349 = ~And you are an eager... follower, I take it?~
@3350 = ~Or, perhaps, you dream of replacing him?~
@3351 = ~I find your words bordering on insult, but I will answer - this time. <CHARNAME> is competent enough, and I am content to follow. Now begone!~
@3352 = ~'Tis not a subject I wish to discuss, especially with you.~
@3353 = ~Oh, I believe I have my answer already.~
@3354 = ~In this maddest of worlds, your sanity is refreshing.~ [O#XAN167]
@3355 = ~I am more than willing to serve.~ [O#XANCE1]
@3356 = ~It is a pleasure to travel with a companion who feels nature so keenly.~
@3357 = ~We haven't been around it much. The way our leader guides us, there are always stone jungles beyond and underneath. I hesitate to admire them... though there is beauty, of course. That moss over yonder warms my heart as would the finest ferns of my old grove.~
@3358 = ~And it is fragile, much as our lives are. A perfect metaphor.~
@3359 = ~We sow death, and one day, we shall reap it. To hope otherwise is to deceive ourselves.~ [O#XAN168]
@3360 = ~Try not to trip over yourself as you continue your dreary way, aye?~ [O#XANHA1]
@3361 = ~Dreary? I would say that your way is far darker than anyone's.~
@3362 = ~Why the scorn in your voice? 'Tis undeserved, I assure you.~
@3363 = ~You put your faith in failure; I in duty. The latter is a reason to live, the former is an affliction.~
@3364 = ~Nay, I am neither the colorless monster nor the slumbering villain you wish to make of me. I am a mortal, a prisoner of this Plane, much as you are. But my way - and I say so freely - is more entertaining. Destruction is art in its purest form; it exhilarates me, while you squeak and hide behind worthless words and flawed incantations. Is it not true?~
@3365 = ~It is unnatural to welcome death, more so to enjoy destruction. You scare me, Haer'Dalis.~
@3366 = ~Ahhh, but why restrain yourself? You have seen it in the depth of your soul, lurking and waiting for its hour! It is come! Fly, and seek ruin as you should!~
@3367 = ~Madness...~
@3368 = ~Nay - destiny. But I see 'twas vain to try and wake up the one who wills himself numb and blind. Remain e'er asleep, grey one; I wash my hands of this.~
@3369 = ~Ugh. The stench... I am surely going to die. My time... (cough) is almost done.~ [O#XAN169]
@3370 = ~Ye better spend some time practicin' yer spells afore the next battle! Some smell nay hurt yer prissy senses.~ [O#XANKO1]
@3371 = ~But it does! If you do not step away... ooohhhhh, I am going to be sick...~
@3372 = ~Imbecile! <CHARNAME>, get yer mage off me! I cleaned me chainmail only last month!~
@3373 = ~Worry... worry not, if you approach me ever again, I will run away as fast as I can. Though it's no use now: the odor has seeped under my clothes. Korgan, the day you die will be a happy day indeed.~
@3374 = ~Watch yer tongue, lest this day comes fer ye right now! I won't say no to it, mind.~
@3375 = ~(groan) After all this, neither will I.~
@3376 = ~(sigh)~ [AERIE33]
@3377 = ~What is it again? Are you hurt?~ [O#XAN170]
@3378 = ~I... I was... thinking about my last nightmare. It was the ugliest, scariest thing I have ever seen in my life!~
@3379 = ~(sigh) Pardon me if I do not ask. This group is renowned for being haunted with night terrors: first <CHARNAME>, then I, now you...~
@3380 = ~Oooohh... does <CHARNAME> have nightmares?~
@3381 = ~Occasionally. Or, at least, <PRO_HESHE> used to have, when we traveled along the Sword Coast. Mine are unceasing, however.~
@3382 = ~What... what do you dream about?~
@3383 = ~Death, Aerie. What else? Excuse me...~
@3384 = ~May I talk to you?~ [O#XANAE3]
@3385 = ~But of course you may. Is there something I can do for you?~ [O#XAN171]
@3386 = ~Y-you can... do something for me, I mean. Have you ever met other Avariel in your travels? In your city?~
@3387 = ~How could I? Your people were extinguished long ago. I am amazed that you still live.~
@3388 = ~But if Faenya-Dail still stands, some other settlements should exist, too! Isn't it... isn't it possible? My own home is far south, but perhaps... perhaps Evereskan sages know of another?~
@3389 = ~Give up hope, Aerie. Harsh as it is, your people are gone, and if some are not, their location is unknown. Think of yourself as an elf, not an avariel.~
@3390 = ~N-no. No. I will not give up who I am. I may sound foolish to you, but I won't give up. Some day, I will find my kin... or return home. Some day.~
@3391 = ~Hm. Hurry up and wait, hurry up and wait - sounds like my days in the Order.~ [O#XANAN2]
@3392 = ~Oh, I don't know. I am quite content to wait as opposed to die.~ [O#XAN172]
@3393 = ~My remark was meant for our leader, not for you.~
@3394 = ~A side to you I am aware of. You are all too eager to please <CHARNAME>, are you not?~
@3395 = ~What are you trying to say?~
@3396 = ~Isn't it obvious? You do not care whether we live or die. You only want to rise, to be respected, to be looked upon with awe. In battle, your conduct is one of a bad actor, constantly seeking appraisal. I do not know how you survived your days in the Order, but I know that soon, you will doom us all.~
@3397 = ~Your petty remarks do not bother me. You are clearly jealous. Prattle as you will - I have better things to do with my time.~
@3398 = ~Hmm. I don't think I have ever looked upon the bustle of the city without keeping a watchful eye out for evil. It seems... quieter.~ [O#XANAN3]
@3399 = ~You were forced to watch for evil, only, and that was all? Are soldiers of the Order denied everything but their duty?~ [O#XAN173]
@3400 = ~Verily, I spent my days in the Order in vigilance. This is the aim of the Order's training. We serve faithfully and ask for little.~
@3401 = ~So, you had to refuse everything? Duty is demanding, and I should know, but... it is cruel, to say the least.~
@3402 = ~'Tis how it should be. You, with your constant sighing and moaning, know nothing of where true duty lies.~
@3403 = ~I know it should not be so consuming, in any case. It is a dreadful thing when teachers replace family, and instruction replaces love.~
@3404 = ~A child needs a strong hand to guide him. So does a squire of the Order. A strict tutor is needed more than a kind guardian.~
@3405 = ~A child does not need a good tutor. He only needs a loving parent, and I see that you had none.~
@3406 = ~Another word about my family, mage, and my blade will slice through you! Watch your tongue!~
@3407 = ~We are the embodiment of balance. The Grand Circle will turn evenly with our influence.~ [CERND04]
@3408 = ~I do not see any balance in our actions. Only death: without reason and justification.~ [O#XAN174]
@3409 = ~Many more are saved, Xan. If not for us, the Earth would lie shattered and desolated.~
@3410 = ~Humans despoiled it and will keep doing so, with or without our help. You'd be interested to know that Irenicus, whom we currently hunt, shattered and desolated the land beneath Athkatla. He created a laboratory of sorts, where he hoped to keep <CHARNAME>, once <PRO_HESHE> was under his 'care'. The prisoner was worth <PRO_HISHER> jailor, however: when <CHARNAME> escaped, not a living soul remained behind. Only corpses.~
@3411 = ~Would you not do the same in order to survive? The creatures inhabiting the dungeon were clearly unnatural, or so I heard.~
@3412 = ~Where does one draw a line, Cernd? I have got so much blood on my hands that I no longer make a difference. Monster, child, orc, human - I do not believe in <CHARNAME>'s ability to restore the balance.~
@3413 = ~You judge too harshly. Nature waits patiently for a new season to come. Let us follow her example and wait.~
@3414 = ~Perhaps. It is not as though we have a choice, at any rate.~
@3415 = ~As though on the wings of pigs I have been granted a fanciful tale of daring and danger amidst the wood! Are you the servants of the wild who restored the balance to this place? The Sword Coast?~ [CERND66]
@3416 = ~Restored the balance? Not as such. "We barely escaped with our lives" is more accurate.~ [O#XAN175]
@3417 = ~Do you tire of praise, Xan? There is no place for false modesty among friends.~
@3418 = ~It was not of our doing. We were only pawns - of some prophecy, or in a game of higher beings, who knows? <CHARNAME> could as well walk the forests and sing songs - nothing would have changed. Victories were awaiting <PRO_HIMHER> as if <PRO_HESHE> were meant for them.~
@3419 = ~But our leader is in dire circumstances now, and it seems that victory hesitates this time.~
@3420 = ~Indeed <PRO_HESHE> is. But with companions like us, <PRO_HESHE> may... (sigh) No. With companions like us, <PRO_HESHE> is only more likely to die.~
@3421 = ~I despise being reduced to this.~ [O#XANED3]
@3422 = ~It was your own stupidity all along.~ [O#XAN176]
@3423 = ~Cruelty, mindless cruelty everywhere! Why must I suffer this form!?~
@3424 = ~Your transformation is only temporary, Edwin. It will be over soon.~
@3425 = ~Eh? How do you know this?~
@3426 = ~It does not take a mastermind to decipher. Soon, you will die, and it will be irrelevant whether your cold and dead body is male or female.~
@3427 = ~Bah!~
@3428 = ~I wish to ask you a question.~ [O#XANHA2]
@3429 = ~Do.~ [O#XAN177]
@3430 = ~Entropy rules our lives; change is but certain. Why do you strive to preserve the remains of a dying race? What fascinating detail lures you?~
@3431 = ~I assume you mean the elves here, on the Prime, as you call it. Yes, we are slowly drawn to extinction. A familiar pattern to you, I am sure.~
@3432 = ~I was branded a Doomguard, 'tis true. Yet your people persist, even if they know they are offered naught but embers. Would a thirsty, restless fire not be a stronger force to embrace?~
@3433 = ~Strangely, I do not see you embracing it. Why would you expect it from us?~
@3434 = ~All cards are in the hand of the Lady. But why would you lament the inevitable? Surely, the Upper Planes beckon you? Embrace the entropy, feel its roars echoing through your soul as your body is broken piece by fragile piece; do not will yourself e'er blind.~
@3435 = ~I am not afraid of death. I fear darkness, the loneliness that will await me for centuries before my blade extinguishes itself, and the gates to Arvanaith fall open. But, by all means, do not let me detain you. If anything, your death will spare me the headache of your unceasing chattering.~
@3436 = ~How tedious. Your lack of courtesy shows itself, my petrel.~
@3437 = ~Your folly exceeds my patience, and your tedium - my intellect.~ [O#XANHA3]
@3438 = ~Do not think I will endure your insults indefinitely.~ [O#XAN178]
@3439 = ~Alas, 'tis a sad and inescapable truth. You are playing a farce, my petrel, and your mask grows tight and heavy. I have been caught in many roles, but ne'er has a martyr been my favorite, neither do you act well.~
@3440 = ~I have no need of your company. Leave me alone, bard.~
@3441 = ~Ah, but you are not hopeless! This gesture with which you closed your eyes - could you repeat it? This sparrow waits for another demonstration with baited breath... if you please.~
@3442 = ~Your quips are tasteless rather than amusing. Do not make me repeat myself.~
@3443 = ~'Tis a pity, then. Ah well.~
@3444 = ~Have I ever told you about my...~ [O#XANJN3]
@3445 = ~(groan) Not again! Not another story of yours... anything but this!~ [O#XAN179]
@3446 = ~Don't interrupt, Xan, it is not polite. Didn't your mother teach you some manners?~
@3447 = ~(sigh) I see that now I am truly doomed.~
@3448 = ~Indeed! So, have I ever told you about my second cousin Xanetta?~
@3449 = ~Seldarine, no!~
@3450 = ~I thought not. She was a fine girl, if a tad unstable. You see, she hated turnips.~
@3451 = ~Unbelievable.~
@3452 = ~Truer word has never been spoken! So, our Xanetta went from house to house, brooding everywhere about how all turnips were cursed, and everyone who would try one will be doomed. She moaned and moaned, until one day, Aunt Marge decided she had enough, and locked poor Xanetta in the turnip cellar, with nothing to eat but turnips.~
@3453 = ~Aaah, by your prompt silence I see that you're all ears. Very good. Xanetta was, too. As soon as Aunt Marge's footsteps died in the distance, she tore the nearest sack and started to munch on the first turnip, without even peeling it. Turned out she liked turnips, after all, and used her moans to distract her unsuspecting aunt! A grave offense, if you ask me.~
@3454 = ~But it turned out Xanetta was right: she was doomed. Nobody can eat seven dozens of turnips and stay alive after that, can they? Aunt Marge and her six nephews had to mop away poor Xanetta's remains for a tenday afterwards.~
@3455 = ~Are you finished?~
@3456 = ~Quite. Oh, and the morale of the story: turnips are best used in moderation. Or you are doooooooooooomed! Heheheh.~
@3457 = ~Ye know, ye and I are nay so different.~ [O#XANKO2]
@3458 = ~Indeed? I cannot imagine what I have in common with a bloodthirsty dwarf.~ [O#XAN181]
@3459 = ~'Tis what ye and I desire, mage. Power. Only, ye does it snakelike, and I grab what I want, when I want.~
@3460 = ~Unlike you, Korgan, I never lusted for power without purpose. If you need to compare yourself against a fellow plunderer, I suggest you take one of our enemies. Any foe will do.~
@3461 = ~Har har! Well said, but our foes be dead, courtesy of me axe. Nay, ye says ye never wanted it, but yer spells betray ye! Last time, ye led 'em like lambs to the slaughter! A coward's way, aye, but effective.~
@3462 = ~I am not proud of it. In Evereska, my enchantments would be working on the pieces of art and lore, not on breaking minds. But here, I will do everything to ensure that <CHARNAME> reaches <PRO_HISHER> goal. Even this.~
@3463 = ~And that, Bag of Tricks, is why we're nay so different.~
@3464 = ~That's been a grand fight, eh, mage?~ [O#XANKO3]
@3465 = ~Mayhap we'll live for some time, yet. Though I doubt it.~ [O#XAN180]
@3466 = ~Don't ye go all clumsy and tremblin' again, elf-boy. So ye die, what of it? The world be best when rid of ye!~
@3467 = ~I thought you would show a flicker of gratitude, given that my magic has once again saved your neck.~
@3468 = ~What for? If I do, next thing ye'll be doing is insistin' on a bigger share of the profits. Keepin' yer whining under my bootheel - now, that be more like it!~
@3469 = ~And none of yer blasted sighing here! Me axe is itching as it is.~
@3470 = ~I do not get through many battles without injury. Why is Minsc always on the front line taking damage?~ [MINSC85]
@3471 = ~Do you wish me on the front line? I could, I suppose, had our leader wanted me to die this badly.~ [O#XAN182]
@3472 = ~Ah, friend Xan, Boo knows you are a great swordsman! Soon, we will see books written of your sword mastery by renown sages!~
@3473 = ~By very drunken sages, I presume. No, Minsc, my fencing skill is far inferior to yours. My moonblade has another purpose: we share a bond, not unlike the one you have with Boo.~
@3474 = ~Does your moonblade give wise advice on the field of battle? Hmm... it looks ready to go for the eyes. Here, Boo, sniff it.~
@3475 = ~Boo says it has much sadness on its shiny, shiny surface. Why is that?~
@3476 = ~It is an elaborate trap, my friend, the one I was forced to accept. Once a holder of a blade dies, his spirit goes to augment the sword's power, and is not released until the blade becomes dormant. I am doomed to the same fate.~
@3477 = ~But Minsc does not understand. How does a big elf fit into a small blade?~
@3478 = ~I do not have to. My body will stay here, to be devoured by worms, ravens, gnolls... (sigh) Never mind, Minsc. Let us go, lest we lag behind, get ambushed, and I become one with my blade even to<DAYNIGHT>.~
@3479 = ~I... I could use a bit of a lie down, lest I drop Boo on the battlefield. Have we a healer near?~ [MINSC83]
@3480 = ~As always, we do not. Abandoned and left to die, as I expected to be.~ [O#XAN183]
@3481 = ~Do not say such a thing! Our leader is the epitome of goodness and butt-kicking!~
@3482 = ~Indeed <PRO_HESHE> is. It is especially notable from the amount of attention <PRO_HESHE> pays to <PRO_HISHER> wounded companions.~
@3483 = ~It is not <CHARNAME>, little elf, it is evil! Evil almost succeeded in making the Sandwiches of Goodness of our heroic butts, and even Minsc's trusty sword was not able to defend Minsc and Boo from the Claws of Wickedness! But we shall rise again, and put our heels into its stinky throat!~
@3484 = ~Of... of course. But hasn't it occurred to you that our illustrious leader carries evil within, as well?~
@3485 = ~No. <CHARNAME> is good. Evil is evil. Minsc is Minsc, and Boo looks upon you with suspicion! We'd best continue quietly, lest he gets angry.~
@3486 = ~Another day of freedom. I never felt like this back in the ballrooms of home.~ [NALIA19]
@3487 = ~What will you use your freedom for? To help another beggar?~ [O#XAN184]
@3488 = ~Please, Xan! This isn't about beggars, and you know it!~
@3489 = ~Aunt Delcia would never allow me to walk in the city. "Lady de'Arnise should ride in a carriage, and by no means walk," she used to say. (giggle!) She would have a fit if she saw me like this!~
@3490 = ~Of course. I never doubted that dirt, dust and bruises added to a lady's appearance.~
@3491 = ~Yes, well... but we help people! If we did not, I would never have joined <CHARNAME> in the first place. A little dirt is just... (sigh) I will get used to it.~
@3492 = ~I do not understand your lightness of heart, Nalia. Your home is in shambles, your family members are dead, and you have naught but the clothes on your back. Why the happiness?~
@3493 = ~I cannot be sad and sour all the time. If I could, I would probably turn into a droning crone.~
@3494 = ~Like me. Why, thank you, Nalia.~
@3495 = ~I did not... Ah, never mind.~
@3496 = ~I cannot defeat Lavok on my own.~ [O#XANVA2]
@3497 = ~And you will not, trust me. Abandon the idea; it will bring you no good.~ [O#XAN185]
@3498 = ~What? Oh, I was talking to myself. I'm sorry, Xan. The company of others is not something I am used to.~
@3499 = ~Not for long, I assure you. Soon, we shall all enter the afterlife - if we are lucky enough, that is. We may just as well stumble across a demon who will gladly devour our souls, and end our miserable existence altogether.~
@3500 = ~It hardly matters how I die. I worship no god, so none shall open their doors to me.~
@3501 = ~So, you deny yourself the afterlife, and do so willingly? Your mind will disappear entirely; you will cease to be in every sense of the word. Why do you stand for this?~
@3502 = ~Gods need worship to survive, but they are flawed and petty as any mortal. I owe my prowess only to myself.~
@3503 = ~What do you stand to gain? Self-satisfaction? It is arrogance of the highest sort, Valygar. You will regret it when the time comes.~
@3504 = ~When the time comes, I shall spit into their eye, with my last breath, if need be.~
@3505 = ~(sigh) Fool.~
@3506 = ~We shall see, mage. To my eye, the fool is you.~
@3507 = ~A fine day to be traveling, I would think.~ [O#XANVA3]
@3508 = ~A fine day? Why, yes. Considering we will be ambushed, tortured, robbed or beheaded before tomorrow, it is a fine day indeed.~ [O#XAN186]
@3509 = ~Why the dark face, Xan? I had not thought you so prone to melancholy.~
@3510 = ~It is simple realism. We are meant to die, and die we shall. I just wish I could see my home again before it happens.~
@3511 = ~I would rather forget my own. No prosperity is worth these memories.~
@3512 = ~I have heard the rumors, if you mean this. But do not cast them away, Valygar. Our memories make us who we are.~
@3513 = ~Wizard, do you even know what you are talking about? Would you, yourself, be able to live with this weight? No, I welcome change, should it come. Better become a new man than endure such bitterness.~
@3514 = ~Do as you will. A new Valygar will die as readily as the old one.~
@3515 = ~By the grace of Shar! No!~ [O#XANVI3]
@3516 = ~Another melodramatic scene, is it?~ [O#XAN187]
@3517 = ~Leave me be, iblith! Ooooh, it is simply intolerable! My head... my head... Stop staring, slug!~
@3518 = ~(sigh) It is not as though I will be repaid, but you healed me. I owe you this. Stand still.~
@3519 = ~Let go! I will... I will... gone. All gone. Was it Lolth or not, I will never know.~
@3520 = ~You'd be better off not knowing, I expect.~
@3521 = ~Bah! It was a mere stray, the heat of this accursed sun, nothing more. Get away from my sight!~
@3522 = ~Can you find no joy in being alive?~ [O#XANYO3]
@3523 = ~Do I have the right?~ [O#XAN188]
@3524 = ~Every man has. Or do you prefer to be sour and dour on a <DAYNIGHT> like this?~
@3525 = ~I do. We were doomed before we were even born, <CHARNAME> most of all. I see no point in spending my last days in joy.~
@3526 = ~My fabulous master of minds, look around! The treasure is in every pore of this city, waiting to be grasped like an eager maiden! Our waterskins bulge with the finest wine! Fortune smiles upon us, says I.~
@3527 = ~Yes, upon you, it does. You escaped Irenicus marvelously: unscarred, unbroken, untainted. Well, look at your companions! They did not! Now repeat that this life is worth living!~
@3528 = ~It is, my inquisitive friend. They will confirm my words. But why should we argue? Let me pour you some of our best brew, and it will speak for me, yes?~
@3529 = ~What? What are you talking about? We never traveled together!~
@3530 = ~But I have heard a lot about your travels, and about your former companions. I even met some of them. Once... a most peculiar encounter...~
@3531 = ~But never mind: I am rambling again. Of course, I know little of your adventures - and it will remain this way, unless you want to tell me more. I apologize for starting this. Let us go.~
@3532 = ~I have little to spare. Purchasing better equipment is my only goal now.~
@3533 = ~Neither. It is simply an instrument.~
@3534 = ~A wise answer. Perhaps... no. You have answered enough questions already.~
@3535 = ~Well, a good day to you, Xan. I suppose.~ [O#XAN000] 
@3536 = ~Aerie, what is the matter? You aren't your usual flighty - err, cheerful self.~ [O#Xan194]
@3537 = ~What's the matter? Who says anything is the matter. Hmph.~
@3538 = ~Oh, come now. I'm not young anymore, you know. I know when - ~
@3539 = ~Now what precisely is that supposed - oh, never mind, I see.~
@3540 = ~Well, if you really want to know something, it might interest you to know that <CHARNAME> was crying her eyes out all last night.~
@3541 = ~I suspect you exaggerate. And I would ask what that has to do with anything at all, but I am afraid I know the answer.~
@3542 = ~All because a certain someone didn't even speak to her yesterday at supper.~
@3543 = ~I was preoccupied! In case it has escaped your notice, we are engaged in a desperate fight for our lives!~
@3544 = ~Of course, Xan. I am sure whatever you were thinking about is a whole lot more important than how <CHARNAME> feels.~
@3545 = ~Oh, you females are insufferable! You are like hornets: offend one and the whole damned hive comes after you. This conversation is over.~
@3546 = ~And for that matter, last night - ~
@3547 = ~Over!~
@3548 = ~You make me ill.~ [O#XAN000]
@3549 = ~I beg your pardon, good squire?~ [O#Xan195]
@3550 = ~I can hold my peace no longer! If some vile demon threatened our <CHARNAME>, I would smash its head in; the least I can do to you, though we are comrades, is to speak my mind.~
@3551 = ~Speak on, then. It seems that everybody wishes to speak their mind to me, these days.~
@3552 = ~Very well. This I say: you do not know the treasure you have possessed. A lady as pure, as wise, as temperate as <CHARNAME> is like, is like a - ~
@3553 = ~Temperate? Well, I might see my way to agreeing on every other count, but - ~
@3554 = ~ - is like a crown of gold and precious stones, that if a man sees it, he would sell all he has if he could buy it. That was how my superior in the Order spoke of its teachings, but it is as true of a peerless lady as <CHARNAME>. If her affections were mine, I would not cast them away so heedlessly. Nay: I would first lay down my life.~
@3555 = ~You might end up laying down your life anyway. And for what?~
@3556 = ~It would be worth the price.~
@3557 = ~Then take her! If you want her so badly, she is yours. Perhaps she would be happier in the arms of such a dander-headed fool - forgive me. You are not a fool, Anomen, except in this. You are young: and young for a human is young indeed. You do not know what you are speaking of.~
@3558 = ~Perhaps I do not, but from my own heart, I speak the truth. Verily, I do wish that the lady <CHARNAME>'s love were mine - but I am a man of the Order, and I do not take by force what does not belong to me. And the lady's love belongs to you.~
@3559 = ~Perhaps it did once. But all things pass in time.~
@3560 = ~The best things do not perish.~
@3561 = ~Perhaps it is precisely the best things that do, and do most quickly.~
@3562 = ~My learned compatriot! A moment of your time.~ [O#XAN000]
@3563 = ~(sigh) Yes, what is it?~ [O#Xan196]
@3564 = ~I merely wished to speak you regarding this <CHARNAME> business...~
@3565 = ~Ye Gods! Do even you see fit to meddle in our affairs? Does the heart of a romantic beat somewhere deep even in your corrupted breast, that you can't bear to see the two of us parted? Truly, this world is drawing to its end.~
@3566 = ~No, no, you mistake me completely (frightened with false fire! I fear this fool is in an odd state of mind). In point of fact, I wished to congratulate you.~
@3567 = ~To... congratulate me?~
@3568 = ~Yes! I have always figured you for a sensible man, perhaps (though truth be told, this is not saying very much) the most sensible in our company (aside from of course myself). And now I see I was not mistaken. Though, for a time, you did behave in a most revoltingly sentimental fashion, you have at last come to your senses.~
@3569 = ~Come to my senses? Are you trying to make a fool of me, Edwin?~
@3570 = ~Not in the least, my friend! (after all, why should that require the least effort on my part?) You have at least realized that in this world, the only sensible thing is to look after one's self. A temporary alliance - between comrades, or between a man and woman - is all fine and good, yet in the end...~
@3571 = ~Oh dear, I believe I see where this is going.~
@3572 = ~In truth, I nearly envy you! You have torn <CHARNAME>'s still-beating heart from her bosom and crushed it beneath your heel. Truly, such magnificent callousness would not be amiss in Thay. <CHARNAME> is, after all, a beautiful young woman who seemed to love you deeply, and I do not know if even I could have behaved so practically...~
@3573 = ~Oh, Gods damn you, Edwin!~
@3574 = ~Now see here, man, haven't you understood me? I commend you!~
@3575 = ~Yes, and don't you see? Now I really do suspect I may have made a mistake...~
@3576 = ~Bah, I don't understand you monkeys at all! Perhaps I overestimated you.~
@3577 = ~Well, don't let me slow your progress away from my person.~
@3578 = ~Whatever you are about to say to me, girl, you'd be better off keeping it shut. I don't like that gleam in your eye.~ [O#Xan197]
@3579 = ~Aw, Xan! Since when did I ever have a gleam in my eye?~
@3580 = ~Since the day you were born, I'll wager.~
@3581 = ~No, no, this is really important!~
@3582 = ~(sigh) What is it, then?~
@3583 = ~Well, ah - *ahem* Xan, Xan; you've gotta come quick! <CHARNAME>'s in the river, and she's gotten attacked by some bandits. Led by a - Sahuagin Bhaalspawn!~
@3584 = ~Why do I find myself somewhat incredulous?~
@3585 = ~Y-you gotta come quick, it's terrible! She can't fight them all herself, and this guy is huge!~
@3586 = ~And yet Sahaugin are saltwater creatures. Interesting.~
@3587 = ~They're using - magic?~
@3588 = ~You are trying to get me to run up on <CHARNAME> while she's bathing, aren't you? And you expect that some sort of - old flame will be rekindled, don't you?~
@3589 = ~Ah, well...~
@3590 = ~(sigh) Imoen, Imoen. Honestly. I don't believe the gods themselves could change what's happened. Do you actually think that you might?~
@3591 = ~Aw. But you guys were so cute together.~
@3592 = ~Contrary to your seeming philosophy of existence, you will find that there is a great deal more to life than being 'cute.'~
@3593 = ~Xan, beg pardon, but might I have a word?~ [O#XAN000]
@3594 = ~I believe I sense an upbraiding coming on.~ [O#Xan198]
@3595 = ~Don't be ridiculous - as if I was your mother! I only wish to have an honest discussion, as compatriots...~
@3596 = ~In which you upbraid me.~
@3597 = ~Hmph. As I was saying, I am merely - surprised at your recent treatment of <CHARNAME>. Of course it is not my place to tell either one of you how to go about living - ~
@3598 = ~Then why do I get the feeling you are about to do exactly that?~
@3599 = ~Very well! If you do not want my courtesy, I am quite prepared to ram the truth down your throat. Now pull up a seat; I see you about to slink away.~
@3600 = ~... Yes, ma'am.~
@3601 = ~Good: I promise I will be brief. Xan, I have buried a husband. The time that we have to spend in this world, with the ones we love, is brief. Therefore it seems to me not only foolish, but unnatural, that we should wilfully keep ourselves apart.~
@3602 = ~I am afraid I don't see what you are getting at.~
@3603 = ~Look at <CHARNAME>. She is wasting away before our eyes - ~
@3604 = ~Well, that seems to be putting it rather strongly. In fact it seems to me that, all things considered, she has taken it remarkably in stride. As I knew she would.~
@3605 = ~And her divinity? The many foes still out for her blood? Her treacherous friends? <CHARNAME> is strong, Xan, she possesses an enormous strength of spirit. As do you, as do we all: otherwise we would not be standing here, together. Yet there is only so much a mortal soul can bear. And now you would remove from her what slight support she has?~
@3606 = ~I have listened to what you have to say. But the matter is between me and <CHARNAME>. It doesn't matter if your counsel is right: when it comes to the heart, there is no right or wrong, only a heedless lunacy. Who knows why we behave the way we do, why we wound each other? I don't believe what I am doing is right. But I believe that it is the only thing I can do.~
@3607 = ~Is it? Think on it, and think carefully: there may be another option. Think on now. Soon it may be too late.~
@3608 = ~I have thought on it much, Jaheira. And it may already be too late.~
@3609 = ~Ach, pale pointy-ear! Ah must say, whate'er yer faults, ye got decent taste in meat.~ [O#XAN000]
@3610 = ~Err, meat?~ [O#Xan199]
@3611 = ~Skirts! Fillies!~
@3612 = ~Oh, you mean, ah - ladies. Womenfolk.~
@3613 = ~What'er ye say. So like I be tellin' ye, that <CHARNAME> looks mighty appetizin', these days. Ah might be tempted to break off a piece o' that meself.~
@3614 = ~Surely you jest, you revolting little creature.~
@3615 = ~Do ah, now? Look yonder at the curve o' that back - the arch o' that foot. Ah dinnae know if ah can restrain meself much longer, Xanny.~
@3616 = ~But, Korgan, you don't like - tall women.~
@3617 = ~Who be sayin' so? Ah once had a fling wit' an elf, some years by. Moon elf she were. She used tae do the - ~
@3618 = ~I certainly don't want to hear about that. Anyway, keep well clear of <CHARNAME>, or I'll be singeing your beard off.~
@3619 = ~Ah heh, heh! Yer not what ye seem to be, pale pointy-ear.~
@3620 = ~Wait. You couldn't have bought that new scabbard with just your share of the last haul of loot.~
@3621 = ~That little devil put you up to this, didn't she?~
@3622 = ~Oi, <CHARNAME>! If he figgers it out, I still get me gold, eh right?~
@3623 = ~Comrade!~ [O#XAN000]
@3624 = ~Ah-heh, haven't I told you not to strike my sh-shoulder quite so hard? You know my bones are rather fragile...~ [O#XAN200]
@3625 = ~I am very sorry; but just as I try to restrain my great might, perhaps you, my friend, could try to become more hardy, yes?~
@3626 = ~Well - perhaps. Anyway, what was it you wanted to talk to me about?~
@3627 = ~Well, it is a simple matter. Minsc would hardly think it worth mention, but Boo is curious. I suppose the mark of his genius is his curiosity.~
@3628 = ~Well then, what does, ah, Boo want to know?~
@3629 = ~Boo says that in the past, Xan and <CHARNAME> would often walk very close together. They seemed to like each other much. They stood by each other in battle, they went off together at night. Sometimes they kissed.~
@3630 = ~...~
@3631 = ~All that's as it should be, says Boo. But recently...~
@3632 = ~Tell Boo to keep his furry little nose out of other people's business.~
@3633 = ~Do you truly wish to speak so rudely? I am a gentle man, but I fear that Boo may take offense. Reconsider!~
@3634 = ~Minsc, there's some thing you don't - Gods bless you, there's some things you just don't - ~
@3635 = ~Comrade! What is the matter? Your face is wet.~
@3636 = ~Are you - are you weeping? But this cannot be; surely this sort of behavior does not become a man.~
@3637 = ~Don't be ridiculous; I am not crying... Have you ever seen me cry before?~
@3638 = ~Get away from me.~
@3639 = ~Truly, comrade, I am sorry if Boo's inquiry caused you pain; he only meant to - ~
@3640 = ~I said get away, you oaf! I need to be alone.~
@3641 = ~Boo says that perhaps you are alone too often, friend.~
@3642 = ~I don't give a damn what you or your hamster says. Leave me be.~
@3643 = ~You know, Xan, as of late, I find myself in a quandary.~ [O#XAN000]
@3644 = ~Do tell.~  [O#XAN201]
@3645 = ~I take it from your tone you would rather I didn't. And so I will.~
@3646 = ~You see, I am certain that I despise you as a contemptible, sniveling coward: yet are you a coward because you sought to hide from death's embrace in the arms of a frightened, confused young waif? Or because, no sooner had that pitiful fling begun to deepen into something like real attachment, than you immediately turned tail and left the girl to the hells, all to save your own hide?~
@3647 = ~Perhaps you understand my dilemma.~
@3648 = ~Oh, honestly, I'm too tired.~
@3649 = ~I suppose I could despise you on both counts, though it would be hypocritical - but in the case of such an outrageous cowardice, perhaps I am justified, hmm?~
@3650 = ~Viconia?~
@3651 = ~Yes?~
@3652 = ~You don't have the slightest conception of what love is.~
@3653 = ~You are truly in a quandary: you manage somehow to be both a walking hotbed of perverse carnal lust, and at the time absolutely frigid. I doubt you have ever loved anyone of either sex deeply or satisfactorily, or perhaps ever will. And the same is true for all your misbegotten race.~
@3654 = ~I am a fool. But I least count myself a trifle better than you.~
@3655 = ~Ah, darthiir. What is it the humans say? 'Sticks and stones...'~
@3656 = ~~
@3657 = ~~
@3658 = ~<CHARNAME>, are you - are you al-alright?~ [O#XAN000]
@3659 = ~Yes, I am. Thank you for asking.~
@3660 = ~Take a good look, Aerie. Can I be all right, do you think?~
@3661 = ~No, Aerie. I am about to die.~
@3662 = ~I-I am sorry, I suppose. I didn't mean to be rude... I just wanted you to know that you have f-friends here. Alright?~
@3663 = ~Alright, alright. Now let us go.~
@3664 = ~Why, I... I am touched.~
@3665 = ~Xan is dead. No words can return him, Aerie, so stop.~
@3666 = ~No, it is not! Foolish girl, leave me be!~
@3667 = ~It is kind of you to say so, <CHARNAME>. H-hold on, will you?~
@3668 = ~Please, do not shout, <CHARNAME>. I know you are hurting, and want to help!~
@3669 = ~Thank you, Aerie, but here and now I'd rather be alone.~
@3670 = ~I know, but not now. We will talk later, all right?~
@3671 = ~Thank you. I accept your help gladly.~
@3672 = ~I do not want to listen! Can't you just be silent?~
@3673 = ~Yes... I-I am sorry.~
@3674 = ~My lady, may I... ?~ [O#XAN000]
@3675 = ~What, Anomen? You cannot return Xan to life, can you?~
@3676 = ~No! Leave me alone!~
@3677 = ~Yes? You have something to say?~
@3678 = ~I am truly sorry about your misfortune. Helm knows, I wish things could have turned out differently. I know how close you were, and... (sigh) I am sorry.~
@3679 = ~Thank you, Anomen.~
@3680 = ~It means a lot to me. Thank you.~
@3681 = ~You are sorry, are you? Well, I do not care!~
@3682 = ~How clear should I be? Leave - me - alone!~
@3683 = ~I am ready to serve, my lady. Alas, I can do very little to soothe your heart.~
@3684 = ~Just remain my friend, Anomen, and I will be content.~
@3685 = ~You have done much downstairs already.~
@3686 = ~What do you imply? I do not want you - leave me be!~
@3687 = ~Of... of course. I humbly beg your forgiveness, my lady. May our comrade rest in peace.~
@3688 = ~Thank you, my lady. It is a great honor indeed.~
@3689 = ~I wish I could offer more than this meager help. It pains me to see you suffer so. But I shall serve you in battle faithfully... and hope that your grief will lessen with time.~
@3690 = ~<CHARNAME>?~ [O#XAN000]
@3691 = ~What is it, Mazzy?~
@3692 = ~Don't tell me you are going to talk about Xan...~
@3693 = ~Yes?~
@3694 = ~Nothing, it is just - are you well? Perhaps you need some rest?~
@3695 = ~Well enough.~
@3696 = ~My soulmate is dead! Can I be well, Mazzy?~
@3697 = ~There will be no rest until Irenicus lies dead.~
@3698 = ~You lost Patrick, Mazzy. What did you feel right after his death?~
@3699 = ~Forgive my impudence, but I remembered myself during those days in the cage, as the Shade Lord's future consort, so I think I understand you better than most.~
@3700 = ~You do not have to answer me. Just... listen.~
@3701 = ~When someone you love dies, you start to think about him, hesitantly at first, then it becomes like a river. You are constantly reminded of his hand in yours, of his scent, his voice, his words... and before you know, you are in constant torment, unable to do anything else.~
@3702 = ~And sooner or later, you start to blame yourself. What if you took a different turn, went in a different direction? What if you knew? What if you could prevent the tragedy? You keep mulling it over, and it never ends. Believe me, my friend, I know what I am talking about.~
@3703 = ~So, I will say this now: this was not your fault. Bodhi committed this atrocity, and none of us could do anything. You are free of guilt, and can continue with your life. Remember, <CHARNAME>. Always remember that.~
@3704 = ~Thank you, Mazzy. I will.~
@3705 = ~A timely warning. I will heed your words.~
@3706 = ~Bah, pointless blabber! Let's go.~
@3707 = ~I do not think you understand me at all.~
@3708 = ~What about you, Mazzy? Do you ever feel guilty?~
@3709 = ~You are a wise leader, my friend. I wish I had met you earlier.~
@3710 = ~I hope one day you will realize the truth. Better sooner than later.~
@3711 = ~I could save Patrick now. But now is now, and then was then. There was nothing to be done. Come, <CHARNAME>. To Suldanessellar.~
@3712 = ~So, your jaluk is dead.~ [O#XAN000]
@3713 = ~Shut up, drow! This is none of your business.~
@3714 = ~Kind of you to notice.~
@3715 = ~Yes. Anything else?~
@3716 = ~I do not want to discuss it with you, Viconia.~
@3717 = ~Are you sorry to see him go?~
@3718 = ~You may love him all you want, but for me he was a darthiir - worse than dirt. I will never grieve about the likes of him.~
@3719 = ~But I understand your loss. It is so easy when a male takes care of you, and makes decisions for you. Bah! Surface dwellers can be so stupid.~
@3720 = ~You do not understand, Viconia. Our union was different.~
@3721 = ~Xan and I were equals.~
@3722 = ~Love is not stupid. It is a splendid feeling.~
@3723 = ~Will you SHUT UP?~
@3724 = ~Oh, indeed? Whom are you trying to fool, <CHARNAME>?~
@3725 = ~You are pathetic in your imaginary grief, <CHARNAME>. You did not give a damn about him, and will find yourself another male in a blink of an eye. Why you want to play the fool is beyond me. But suit yourself.~
@3726 = ~<CHARNAME>? Hey, I know it's bad, but talk to me. Please?~ [O#XAN000]
@3727 = ~There is no point, Imoen.~
@3728 = ~What about?~
@3729 = ~Sure. Xan is dead, my soul is gone, and in general, life just isn't worth it.~
@3730 = ~I am all right, little sister. Or at least, I will be.~
@3731 = ~C'mon, <CHARNAME>, doncha know I worry about you? You look sad, and drawn, and you just can't look like that!~
@3732 = ~Promise? You feel all right and no mistake? Aw, sis, it isn't true.~
@3733 = ~Don't think we aren't here for you. We all are - I am, and these funny thieves Aran Linvail sent to help you kill Bodhi, and those queer elves... Now I'm babbling, right? But I honestly want to help.~
@3734 = ~Listen, little sister. I know what Irenicus did to you, because he did the same to me. And it feels dark, cold and creepy at first, and then empty, like you'll never be happy again.~
@3735 = ~But it will become even worse, if you let him get to you. If you let yourself believe that there's nothing worth fighting for. I just know it's wrong. So... don't give up, alright? Please don't.~
@3736 = ~All right, Imoen. I have you with me, we have each other, and I won't give up.~
@3737 = ~I don't know. Everything does feel so empty now.~
@3738 = ~Maybe you are right, but right now I need some time on my own.~
@3739 = ~Remember: good old Imoen is there to help. Will ya?~
@3740 = ~I'll tell you what... I'll be over there if you need me, see? Just over there. Remember: good old Imoen is there to help. Will ya?~
@3741 = ~<CHARNAME>, it is high time we talked.~ [O#XAN000]
@3742 = ~I believe so.~
@3743 = ~And what do you have to say?~
@3744 = ~Jaheira, I want none of your nagging.~
@3745 = ~Oh, yes. You lost Khalid and I - Xan. We have a lot in common, don't we?~
@3746 = ~I was not going to - ~
@3747 = ~Fine. Do what you will.~
@3748 = ~We do not. Each happy couple is happy in their own way; each grieving spouse sheds their tears differently.~
@3749 = ~Do you have nightmares? Visions? Dark thoughts?~
@3750 = ~No, I don't. I remember you did, after Khalid died.~
@3751 = ~Perhaps they will come later.~
@3752 = ~Why do you ask?~
@3753 = ~Before our departure to Spellhold, Khalid came to me in dreams almost every night. During the day, I reminisced on our journeys together. Athkatla, Tethyr, and then Suldanessellar... without him.~
@3754 = ~I am telling you this for a purpose, <CHARNAME>. What you feel is natural, and there are others, who feel... alike. But your pain is unique, and will remain so. You will be always alone with it.~
@3755 = ~You are too young; you may not be ready for this. If I am right, come and talk to me. We share much, even if I am... sometimes... reluctant to admit it.~
@3756 = ~And soon, we will have our revenge.~
